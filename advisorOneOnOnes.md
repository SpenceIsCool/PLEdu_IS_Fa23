- Don’t spend too muc time on one thing
- Do survey of the literature to understand what is out there and what is worth exploring more deeply.
- PL terms: play with analayzer algo, examples, cronrete activities.
    - Trx here: look at problem sets. If I were designing the course, what would I do to “enable collaboration” or “eval students” in finite researchers.
- 3 actions
    - Play with examples
    - Understand the literature
    - Senthysize the contribution.
- bottom up paper writing
    - Start the paper at the beginning.
    - You don’t know whats in the paper sections yet
    - but you know what those sections are: intro, method, experiment, results, dicussion/conclusion
    - Can have contribution bullets (the few things I am adding to the literature)
    - Write some fo the overview: describe the algorithm by example.
    - Drive the semseter by intending to write the paper… can still be the driver
    - just one option, there are other ways to craft human knowledge
- Can split off somethings to your diary rather than a the lab notebook. But lean on the side of keeping information as public as possible (keep it all professional - obviously)
- Advising on the craft of research… 
    - Each week: I should give Evan more of a reason to look at my project and work.
        - Where I work on cs education papers and learn what they are really doing and teach Evan about that work
    - “to create human knowledge is a very active thing”
        - Talk to people
        - Reading is talking to people from the past
    - Can get more of evans attention. Slack is great for quick notice.
    - Bias toward sending more than less. Hey, I read this thing. What do you think. Some subset of what is in the labnotebook can go on my bchannel. It would have the full term of discussions.  Potentilal summaries. Highlights of what is in the github. DM is only for, hey where are you?
