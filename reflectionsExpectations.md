The below document details the purpose and expectations of a self reflection. This is associated with a training quiz on canvas including sample reflections for lab 1 which you must score on an X/check+ system.

# X
Reflection submission shows limited self awareness, it fails to answer all components of the reflection rubric in a meaningful way. An X can also be given for solutions that are so poorly written that they are incomprehensible (like a darft from ChatGPT without additional edits). While ChatGPT is a valid tool in preparing and organizing your thoughts, and even editing. The final submission should be your personal work

# check -
Meets the technical prompts. Fails to demonstrate self awareness.

# check
its fine. It does all the things that are asked

# check +
integrates a future plan and a retrospective of how the previous plan of action was executed and if it was a good plan. Leverages past performance in construction of a plan forward.

# Canvas quiz
- X1: a lack luster reflection that meerly states that a student didn't know something or knew something without any reflection on why they have that mastery level.
- X2: a chatGPT answer that is clearly fake authored
- check-: like X1, but may make a weak attempt at the subsections listed, or missing one or the other.
- check: states
- check+: It state what resources that the student could use to improve performance: readings, persistent time on the assignment, better collaboration with project partner, more active participation in lecture and recitation. It clearly states a goal/plan for the next lab. It reflect on previous labs and how the student has been acting on their action plans tracking this to some levels of success.
