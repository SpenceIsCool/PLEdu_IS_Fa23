    - My thoughts on the process so far

# Monday November 6
- Technical: The past two weeks came with an emphasis on refining my scope and the construction of a "midterm" paper and presentation. With some last minute inspiration to focus on peer-to-peer interactions and reflective "ungrading", I had a few last minute reads to add in on the bloom taxonomy. I also hastily constructed a series of first round informational interview questions to understand what existing TAs thought about the concept.
- Reflective: The discussion with Evan about having some axis of comparison was very important. I'm very greatful to Aishwarya as well for reminding me of the option to perform informational interviews. Ultimately, I think I was able to pull together an acceptable paper and a decent presenation. This certainly would have been better had I better understood this research question earlier in the semester. The presentation came with a lot of good follow up questions that I need to consider.


# Monday October 23
- Technical: Over the past two weeks I have taken a break from reading about what others have done and focused on the construction of sample syllabus for principles of programming languages under different (un)grading models, additionally I have begun constructions of the midsemester paper and presentation
    - draft construction of the traditional syllabus
    - draft construction of a standards based syllabus
    - draft construction of a contract grading syllabus
    - draft construction of a ungraded reflective based syllabus
    - draft construction of a personal typical syllabus
    - continued effort on writing the midsemester paper, including the formating of all citations gathered so far and initial structure of desired essay
- Reflective
    - Certainly a mistake on my end to put the midsemester presentation at the end of October, this actually much later in the semester than I had initially realized. In future terms I would recommend to draft the indepent study agreement to give the mid-semester presentation at week 7 or 8. Due to conference logistics, we are going to do the presentation Novemeber 3. This is scheduled and the slip has been agreed upon between myself and Evan.
    - As I work on writing the paper, I find myself nervous that I'm uncertain exactly what it is that I want to say coming into the first formal assesment of my efforts for the semester. I don't believe that I'll be surprised by the feedback that I receive, but I am frustrated that I don't have more to show for my efforts and that I don't have a deep enough understanding of my research to know exactly what it is that I want to say. I suppose this is part of the process and common enough in doing research. I want to trust the process, but I am nervous. Two things that I am trying to remind myself of:
        - reading a paper is having a discussion with someone from the past - so the paper should be written to support that goal
        - The paper is not a representation of all the experiments attempted, but rather a selection of the experimentation that supports some hypothesis or discussion prompt for the reader. It should excite the reader to learn more about the topic.


# Monday October 09
- Techinal: a light two weeks due to personal leave and issues coming back up to spead. read:
    - Three Approaches to Task-Based Syllabus Design
        - gives ideas about kinds of syllabus to review. old paper
    - Award-winning faculty online teaching practices: Course design, assessment and evaluation, and facilitation
    - Changing Instructor's Roles in Virtual Worlds
- Reflection: thinking about how to teach effectively at scale, there are two obvious trajectories to explore. 1. what are effective ways to teach online. 2. what are effective ways to bring Ai to the classroom. In exploring online teaching I see obvious trends in strong peer-reviewed course design with instructor as facilitator of course discussions and manager of student expectations and timelines with reasonable reminders of upcoming due dates. I did not get a chance to explore Ai in the classroom yet. I'm upset with the lack of progress during these two weeks. I'll have to make up for it in furture sprints.

# Monday September 25
- Techincal: In the second two weeks I focused on various grading methods that adapt course structures away from traditional methods of grading. I also attended one on ones with Evan to understand how to better manage the workload over the long scope of the semester. More specific details:
    - exploration of PL course structures at Technical Unieristy of Munich, Universite Paris Saclay, Stanford
    - attendence of Michael Schneider's student colloquium exploring how to isolate debugging skills from development methods for things like ardiuno
    - 1:1 with Sean about the value of debugging and getting to observe and "expert developer hit a wall"
    - readings on the limited value of traditional grading and how to "ungrade" effectively so student focus more on learning. methods of "Ungrading" and "Specification grading" and the challenges to implement at scale.
    - readings on peer grading, including how to scale the method by certifying students as "ready" to give effective peer grades
    - begin writing the paper (available in the repo)
    - reading on better handling of student office hour queuing using "My digital hand" from harvard - force students to review their understanding of the concepts before meeting with a member of the course staff, and track student interations over the term
    - cra data on course CS enrolment over time
- Reflective: First, I'm actually writing this review on October 6 (as I've been away on travel), this is making it very difficult to recall what all was read in the two week period so far back. In the future, I must write these summary reviews more timely. Further, a few very important breakthroughs came from this two week block of work. First, working with Evan, I was able to refine the scope of the research to "As institutions increase the number of students enrolled in courses, the staff resources per student are decreasing, so what are effective ways to scale effective education of PL to current students?" while we focus on PL courses to control the number of variables in the study, the findings should be valid to most advanced topic studies in other diciplines. Second, to exploring tinkering with the data, it occurs to me that I can author sample syllabi for different grading methods against the current CU CSCI 3155 curriculum as a sample for further analysis to consider what can and would not work well in a large scale upper division classroom.


# Monday September 11
- Technical: In the first two weeks I have focused on reading and project setup. I've created a github page, a google drive, attended standups and setup additional one on ones with Evan. Readings so far are:
    - PL-Detective: A System for Teaching Programming Language Concepts
    - Personalized Attention @ Scale: Talk Isn't Cheap, But It's Effective
    - Standards-Based Grading at Scale in Algorithms
    - Interactive program demonstration as a form of student program assessment
    - In-person grading: an evaluative experiment
    - A Beginnerâ€™s Guide to Standards Based Grading
    - Contemporary Composition: The Major Pedagogical Theories
    - Pedagogical Theories
- Reflective: As I get used to doing the work, I've noticed a few things. First, I am very intimidated by the lack of structure and the long timeline of this work. I undertsand that I need to aim to do work daily. I've been fairly successful in getting myself to do one or two readings on most days and I have a long and growing backlog of readings which I can continue to explore. Now, I have read many papers, but I'm not sure how I'm going to bring that information together. For now, I think I need to keep reading and taking notes like I have been. I want to have a broder knowledge of the space before I begin taking too much time to apply it/bring it all together. Thinking about the timeline. I have two weeks before my trip. When I return from the trip I'll have another two weeks of researching, then I'll enter the midterm period and will need to actively work on my paper and presentation. I have a new plan of attack for when I'll do my work in the early mornings. In this next two week period, I need to spend some time looking at the existing PL courses in addition to continuing my readings on teaching methods.
