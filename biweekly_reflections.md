    - My thoughts on the process so far

- Techincal: In the second two weeks I focused on various grading methods that adapt course structures away from traditional methods of grading. I also attended one on ones with Evan to understand how to better manage the workload over the long scope of the semester. More specific details:
    - exploration of PL course structures at Technical Unieristy of Munich, Universite Paris Saclay, Stanford
    - attendence of Michael Schneider's student colloquium exploring how to isolate debugging skills from development methods for things like ardiuno
    - 1:1 with Sean about the value of debugging and getting to observe and "expert developer hit a wall"
    - readings on the limited value of traditional grading and how to "ungrade" effectively so student focus more on learning. methods of "Ungrading" and "Specification grading" and the challenges to implement at scale.
    - readings on peer grading, including how to scale the method by certifying students as "ready" to give effective peer grades
    - begin writing the paper (available in the repo)
    - reading on better handling of student office hour queuing using "My digital hand" from harvard - force students to review their understanding of the concepts before meeting with a member of the course staff, and track student interations over the term
    - cra data on course CS enrolment over time
- Reflective: First, I'm actually writing this review on October 6 (as I've been away on travel), this is making it very difficult to recall what all was read in the two week period so far back. In the future, I must write these summary reviews more timely. Further, a few very important breakthroughs came from this two week block of work. First, working with Evan, I was able to refine the scope of the research to "As institutions increase the number of students enrolled in courses, the staff resources per student are decreasing, so what are effective ways to scale effective education of PL to current students?" while we focus on PL courses to control the number of variables in the study, the findings should be valid to most advanced topic studies in other diciplines. Second, to exploring tinkering with the data, it occurs to me that I can author sample syllabi for different grading methods against the current CU CSCI 3155 curriculum as a sample for further analysis to consider what can and would not work well in a large scale upper division classroom.

- Technical: In the first two weeks I have focused on reading and project setup. I've created a github page, a google drive, attended standups and setup additional one on ones with Evan. Readings so far are:
    - PL-Detective: A System for Teaching Programming Language Concepts
    - Personalized Attention @ Scale: Talk Isn't Cheap, But It's Effective
    - Standards-Based Grading at Scale in Algorithms
    - Interactive program demonstration as a form of student program assessment
    - In-person grading: an evaluative experiment
    - A Beginnerâ€™s Guide to Standards Based Grading
    - Contemporary Composition: The Major Pedagogical Theories
    - Pedagogical Theories
- Reflective: As I get used to doing the work, I've noticed a few things. First, I am very intimidated by the lack of structure and the long timeline of this work. I undertsand that I need to aim to do work daily. I've been fairly successful in getting myself to do one or two readings on most days and I have a long and growing backlog of readings which I can continue to explore. Now, I have read many papers, but I'm not sure how I'm going to bring that information together. For now, I think I need to keep reading and taking notes like I have been. I want to have a broder knowledge of the space before I begin taking too much time to apply it/bring it all together. Thinking about the timeline. I have two weeks before my trip. When I return from the trip I'll have another two weeks of researching, then I'll enter the midterm period and will need to actively work on my paper and presentation. I have a new plan of attack for when I'll do my work in the early mornings. In this next two week period, I need to spend some time looking at the existing PL courses in addition to continuing my readings on teaching methods.
