I explain that they are very common in the departments required courses and represent 2 - 6 interviews per term in at least 4 of the required courses of the curriculum. Jessica thinks this sounds interesting. I also note that they are common in our department but perhaps not pervasive in CS beyond our department.\n",

    "        1. students that are prepared for the interviews and largely perceive this as a \"box to check\"\n",

    "        4. each profile has positives and negatives.\n",
    "    11. Jessica notes that the interviews in practice to get information to publish my findings might look like: some random samplings or students in the p2p model, or some things where students do an interview with their peers, and with the TA and with just me. She notes the data bias that arises from 1 student doing all three interviews and the succession of these interviews.\n",
    "    12. To better leverage future discussions with Jessica I need to know the answer to the following questions so that we can document the base needs of the course vs what is eligible for changes.

But to know what students in Fall 2022 CSCI 3155 at CU Boulder experienced is not yet known and is not yet documented. So I could focus my learning on these students experiences. Having said that, I think there is some important balance to strike.

It's something in between the we want value at scale, and we don't really want to pre-suppose the peer interview grading is the solution to this problem.

We want to organize peer to peer student interactions which help the students individually grow a deeper understanding of the material while building social connections (which are shown to help with learning). We want to help the students identify where they are in their own learning journey (?relative to their own learning goals?).\n",
