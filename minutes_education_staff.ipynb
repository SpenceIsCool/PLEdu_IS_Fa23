    "- William Penuel: questions about CoBi and applications to my process. Emphasis on the value in equity for the research.\n",
    "    - Prof Penuel, \n",
    "    - I hope that this email finds you well. I am reaching out to see if you have anytime this year for a brief 30 minute meeting to discuss your work with CoBi and it's potential application in a college classroom. The paper is inspiring to hear about leveraging Ai in understanding student engagement and I believe it could lend itself to working well at a larger scale while centering equity in the tool outcomes. \n",
    "    - I am a current masters student in the department of computer science exploring methods for effective education at scale in the college setting. In short, over time we have seen higher enrollment in upper division classes in Computer Science and continued challenges in how to effectively engage and assess our students effectively. Our department often relies heavily on the use of interview grading with an \"expert\" to facilitate the conversation, but with this our students often get limited feedback. I'm currently exploring a method of peer to peer interview grading to potentially better engage the students and allow staff to prioritize feedback and intervention with the students that need it most. I am very curious to understand what role CoBi could play in assessing the student level of engagement with these recorded interviews and how the tool could potentially be used to build better student teams and improve equity for students in mastering the course material.\n",
    "- Lorrie Shepard: what is the goal of the assessment, how do we incentivize it?\n",
    "    - Prof Shepard,\n",
    "    - I hope that this email finds you well. I am reaching out to see if you have anytime this year for a brief 30 minute meeting to discuss your article on \"Ambitious Teaching and Equitable Assessment\" and how these concepts might be applied in a large scale college classroom. The article is incredibly informative and matches well to what I strive for in providing effective education, but I'm rather intimidated on how the concepts could be applied to a three hundred student lecture.\n",
