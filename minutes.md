- setup this github repo
- continue work on IS form. I'm a bit concerned about the timeline, but I trust that Evan will work with me and not leave me in the cold on this. In the interim, I can begin my research and see how that better informs the IS form. I'm unsure if I can submit the proposed syllabus that Evan wants, or if I'll need to take it and reformat it to a few high level bullet points. Consider adding citations that I'm taking the format from Evan, but more correctly I believe it's from the CMU sylabus (need to check that).

- Attended many CTL discussions. I have a lot of names to review to read further on ungrading and see if they have publications on the topic for college level teaching. the speaker suggested that to be true
- Attended in-person stand up to introduce self. I felt a bit out of place, but its the first time, so that's kind of to be expected.
- Schedule IS form review.

- attended talk on justice in programming langauges with Amy Ko from Univeristy of Washington. Great points on accessibility, playfulness and inclusivity in PL. The langauge is purely functional and stream based. I've scheduled further review of her work and potentially reaching out.
- completed IS form for review.
