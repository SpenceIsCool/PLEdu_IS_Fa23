    - 2019
    - to me, online = scale, so the methods used here should be valuable to my research
    - discusses specific challenges of change to online learning and the trend to have more courses online
    - looks at faculty that are successful in teaching online
    - online courses are typically designed and reviewed in a way that they are refined over time
    - multiple choice is valid, but there is so much value in having students collaborate and get feedback from course staff on their work from time to time. Important to not have the students feel isolated
    - students percieve more value from instructor lead facilitation as apposed to student lead events
    - very designed in advance and starts with the syllabus. what do you expect students to be able to do, how do you expect them to do it. focus on alignment of the syllabus, learning outcomes, assignments, learning activies and learning technologies available. Focus on consisten organization.
        - what are the goals of the unit of work
        - what are the deadlines for the unit
        - what are realistic expectations about the amount of time it should take to complete the work for the unit
    - important to have students have a way to interact with eachother - build a sense of community. can be creative, can be writing forums, can include voice threads or videos. personal thought: can include required zoom calls or in person meetings between students. creative fasion of presenation can help students express material mastery on their own terms.
    - rubrics are a must - see other readings on rubric methods
    - discussions of peer review within faculty before course publication, while logistically challenging, this would be valuable for in person teaching as well.
    - timely feedback and regular checks on message forums is important to the students (also true for in person classes). likewise, need availability from the staff. LOTS of work up front can make it easier and lower workload later in the class. Use of video and inperson discussion is great to give body language and voice tone rather than just some text that can be interpreted different ways by students.

    - instructor roles are : pedagogical, coscial, managerial, and technical
    - a push away from instructro as expert to instructor as facilitator of students creating valuable content to demonstrate their mastery of the material. emphasis on remote learning, but seems valuable to in person learning - to me
    - students are digital natives and the traditional classroom may not make sense to them (e.g. they can google and correct you on the fly), so instructor methods should evolve accordingly
    - personal challenge: how do we get the less engaged student to engage in class, how do we gently ask students that contribute a lot to step back and let some other students contribute before they themselves do.

# T: Sept 19, 2023
- Did not get work done on Monday 9/19
- In preparation for meeting with Evan this week I've written up some notes to keep me on track during our meeting.Lets see if that helps.
- Reviewing last weeks 1:1, I realized that I hadn't started writing the paper yet. I've now made a base `.tex` file. I need to dig into this deeper. It's a large and intimidating endevor, but the minimal possible step was making the file and that is done plus some section headers and some starting filling text. Unsure if I should keep that here in git, or go over to OverLeaf so I can visualize the paper. Something to consider.
- I'm not keen on the lack of english language support here in my current setup (vim in .md files). Perhaps I should start to transition my lab notebook to Jupyter Notebooks? It's worth trying...

# U: Sept 17, 2023
- Evan's recent exploration into peer grading has inspired me to explore this topic further for CS education. I see this as something that could potentially scale. In my own experience this requires motivated students and so I certainly caution using this in certain classes. It can lead to scenarios where the blind lead the blind and the unmotivated demotivate the motivate. Personally, I've rarely found myself in peer-review/peer-grading that has been done well, but I'd bet some people have written about this.

        - 2001
        - emphasis on www distributed grading and how its important to help students understand how to use the tool
        - great for helping distance and in-person student working together
        - potentially: the best work can be saved and used as example in future terms: NOTE: you need to get permission for this, but its worth asking students in the current semester.
        - uses double blind reviews, with multiple reviews and average is scored
        - phases:
            1. signup: limit by the topic
            2. submit: an initial draft is submitted for early feedback
            3. initial feedback: to make the review helpful, students need time to iterate
            4. grading
            5. review of review: the author needs to consider if the review was usesful, what was useful, what was not useful - can be shared out through the double-blind platform.
            6. publishing
        - freshmen -> graduate courses tried in CS
        - peer reviews help build accountability for the student to complete work on time to give the reviewers time to respond. need to build in wiggle room for the author and reviewer to negotiate timeline if either is falling behind. In general this builds a soft skill for students to learn how to communicate expectations.
        - Peer grading = PG

        - 70 students enrollment on CS writing, but claims it would work on code - I'm inclined to agree
        - students don't percieve peer feedback as being as valuable as feedback from TA or instructor
        - Students have two groups
            - supervised reviewer: not yet proven worthyness or lost worthy status as reviewer
            - independent reviewer: decided as trustworthy in giving peer review
        - calibration: students are given known quality submissions and a rubric (authored by the instructor or samples from previous semesters student work). the students give a peer review for the work. If they are close to correct in scoring, then they are marked as independent.
        - TAs randomly review work, if things don't match expectations, then independent reviewers can have status moved to supervised and vise-versa
        - try to pair up supervised reviewers and independent reviewers to the same assignment so if there are 2 indepent reviewers with grade agreement and the supervised reviewer independently comes to grade agreement, then we can move the supervised reviewer to independent status.
        - Students may request a re-grade from TA, but they must state in writing why the provided peer review is not sufficient.
    - `https://escholarship.org/uc/item/5tx38648`
        - 2022
        - emphasis on MOOCS and college. works with larger data sets, but I expect the findings are still valuable.
        - "olympic average": remove highest and lowest data points, then take average
        - rubric is very important to set the expectations of the peer review process
        - had to be careful to let people reject review if a submission was formatted oddly, but also didn't want people just taking the assignments that are easiest to review.
        - "While students intuitively understand that small random errors will be averaged out, they are very concerned by large errors that, they fear, will skew their overall grade"... but this wouldn't be true for local classes in the 20 - 300 student range...
        - having the reviews be signed up for means that each writeup gets a review before each writeup gets a second review and so on...
        - review feedback/review of review scale: 1. factually wrong/bogus 2. unhelpful 3. neutral 4. somewhat helpful 5. very helpful 
            - "There is clear evidence of tit-for-tat behavior when students give feedback on the reviews they receive"
            - to be clear, the review feedback is likely similar to the grade given by the reviewer, a high grade gets a high feedback score and same for low grade and low feedback score.
            - In this study and its specific environment this was not found to be helpful. This conflicts with the smaller study detailed above. Based on previous readings on the value of self reflection in learning, I believe that the review feedback can be a valuable part of the autor and reviewers learning experience, but I see why we wouldn't want to tie the reviewers grade in the course to this metric.

        - notes on the challenge of peer grading. they do 5 reviews for each assingment, but it can be a "14 yo from africa without the prereqs" and this drags down the quality of discussion in the MOOK.
        - Coursera is working on software to help gague the quality of peer reviewers.

## ungrading
- I attended a great talk on ungrading during the CTL fall intensive with Michaele Ferguson. History is complex, but most recent advancements come from CoVid era and allowing teachers to give more value to students with better use of time for the prof. When executed well this means the students focus more on what they are learning and less on the points they are earning. The talk does warn about issues of scale and being uncomfortable passing on certain grading roles to TAs (reminds me a lot of what the department tends to expect of TAs during grading interviews). There is a focus on writing self-reflections on what the student is learning and that reflection itself is a part of the total grade.
- a colleciton of resources https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wV9GCLXb7F73GWDroxJ_k7UFy-OqdlAN
### Specification grading
- https://www.insidehighered.com/views/2016/01/19/new-ways-grade-more-effectively-essay
    - good overview
    - need to be specific on what is good enough, better and not acceptable
    - need to build in some flexibility - great to have the ability to resubmit
    - describes as "bundles" to be satisfacory in all bundles to get an A in the course
    - doesn't talk about buy in, but I feel certain, that if this is not status quo of the institution you need to spend a decent amount of time on buy in from the students throughout the term like what we see in standards based grading.
    - THOUGHT: buy in is always important and it must be woven into the core of the course to be successful
- https://justtv.wordpress.com/2016/02/16/rethinking-grading-an-in-progress-experiment/
    - specification grading as an alternative to contract grading
    - learning goals of the course and separation into bundles. students must get satisfactory state in certain number of bundles to get the grade of choosing.
    - THOUGHT: can I sample syllabus to each of these methods for CSCI 3155 as my expertise and use this as samples of what this **could** look like.
### Ungrading
- https://wvupressonline.com/node/844
    - book on many teachers experiences with ungrading
- https://www.jessestommel.com/how-to-ungrade/
    - author claim: grading is bad and we all know that to be true
    - grading is often something that takes time away form what the prof cares about
    - institutional pressure and history is important to this. A lot of grading methods do not explore critical thinking and what we really want our students to be capable of beyond the classroom.
    - emphasis on self-reflection and self evaluation
        - THOUGHT: this should also be super important to help the students know their own value and better handle discussions of raises and more in the 'real world'.
    - the self evaluation more often has people under grading themselves then overgrading. We give the student that power. if the student massively undergrades themselves then we step in and discuss with them if that is right and why that isn't right.
    - contract grading is an option: we can negotiate these. it is clear about what students must do to succeed
    - students can write their own rubrics
    - at 300 students you can write a letter ot the full class about trend s in the course rather than working with each student individually.
- https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2019/04/02/professors-reflections-their-experiences-ungrading-spark-renewed-interest-student
    - culture and stress of ungrading is hard for the prof as well. what will your peers think of you if you "ungrade". what will the department do if you give students the grades they self report?
    - it is rare to have students give themselves a higher grade then they deserve.
    - likely won't work just for the prof at 200/300 students. you would need triage to send the student to the right support and feedback on the course.
    - one example of students saying they can do nothing and get an A and another student set suggesting that students cannot be trusted and they need the prof to help them manage their grading and give them some objective score.
- https://www.jessestommel.com/ungrading-a-bibliography/
    - the best way to start is an open discussion with students about their grading method. also important to have this conversation with peer instructors to build a community about your methods and the strengths and weeknesses of the method.
        - this happens more in younger education, but often not emphasized at uni's - its not a part of the 40/40/20
    - "Unconditional Parenting: Moving From Rewards and Punishment to Love and Reason." Kohn
    - there is racism embeded in the current grading method (and other bias of gender, class and more)
    - grades primarily motivate students to work against poor grades then actually encouraging learning.
### grades aren't helpful
- https://www.alfiekohn.org/article/case-grades/
    - the use of letters as valuabtive summaries of the student understanding of the topic
    - 80s and 90s phsych studies on students. grades actually diminish student interest in what they are learning
    - more interested: is this going to be on the test?
    - less interest: is that statement true?
    - spending more focus on the goal the less thetime they can spend on actually achieving the goal? study harder can take more time to become a master
    - cannot often measure the value of your teaching in objective quant measures
    - the measure of how many algos a student has memorized is not the right metric
        - PERSONAL NOTE: sometimes these algos are practicle to learn as a basis for the next step. At scale you could not give the freedom to students to find what will prepare them individually for meeting their own learning goal
    - a comment and no grade: the student will read the comment.
    - grades are sometimes used to CONTROL students
    - 



# R: Sept 14, 2023
- 1:1 discussion with Sean about debugging: there is so much value in learning how to debug. How to see the error messages and stack trace of a problem and then use that information and the internet to find a solution. Story of having to compile the linux kernel many times. The likelyhood of equity issues and access to technology at a young age. Note that the process for doing this debugging is learnable and often easy to learn, but many college courses assume that students already know it or assume that students can easily teach it to themselves. Its actually rarely tough in entry level courses. Its actually not easy to learn on your own - although it is possible. Discussions about the idea of live coding and live debugging. A recomendation that the most value comes from watching someone that is very competent in their technical domain coming up against a wall and finding a path forward from that. Challenges to implement this in the classroom. There are papers on live coding and I agree there is value in live debugging be a part of that (challenges in timeing during a live class to live debug hard problems). It could be possible as live code-with-me videos where the dev talks to a rubber duck while debugging some issue.

- FABLEARN: how to create and learn. here target demographic is youth.
- how to allow students to fail. dioes the system view failure as a positive as we often learn more from our failures then our successes
- hardware and software features. often students will get to an issue and they will wait to hope someone will solve the problem for them. occasionally they ewill try to fix it by starting over. need a way to help them understand the real issuesand gain troubleshooting skills. Here the embeded system with ahrdware and software, the issue is hard to isolate. can give tools, but still need learned skills and behaviors to do that. first time through we often tinker (trial and error approaches).
- time spent giving technical info on how to debug, we aren't actually exploring the problem space. We are exploring the how to debug things space... could be a problem. a modification of breakpoint to work on live info, not the static data of software, but also the info in the embeded hardware while stopping the program.
- ideation is a key part of design. it's a key stage to make early (cheap) changes.
- the tool is not designed to identify the issue, but to make it easy to ask questions cheeply and find the issue on your own.
- focusing on separating concerns. here an emphasis on tinkering debugging. moving into strategic debugging in future iterations.

# R: Sept 07, 2023
- READING: Continue: INTERACTIVE PROGRAM DEMONSTRATION AS A FORM OF STUDENT PROGRAM ASSESSMENT
    - Need to pickup later. stuck on page 70 (6 of 14). Should move back up the document...
    - demonstartion grading. student does the work. she asks for a 1:1 there in lab. she shows her work. the instructor points out ops for improvement. think oral exam, but code based. Can suggest extentions and changes to the spec. closed loop with ops to discuss good and bad. comes with live debugging from the student as the code is expanded. We can grade the student's flexibility/"agility" in debugging (flexible to the student's needs and ability).
    - show program robustness by suggesting new tests that show the limit of the code.
    - student is prompted with questions of the code. see if they have learned or mearly copied things (in some valid way).
    - early misunderstandings are caught and can be discussed at the class level
    - recomendation for large classes: use office hours, TAs iff they are well prepared, could be done with async video but loose the in-person value
        - PERSONAL NOTE: this paper suggests that upper divisions are small classes, but this isn't true at CU and other large isntitutions today. the paper is a bit old... I likely want to look at lower division essays as they likely already focus on LARGE classrooms.
    - methods again: written submission, automated grading, peer review, and public presentations
    - this paper focuses on developing personal rlationships between the instructor and the students...
    - THOUGHT: is it possible to have the TAs do some of the lectures and course prep to then offload this grading responsibility to the instructor? I think it's doable, but is it appropriate? Is it right?


# W: September 6, 2023
- review of papers I was interested in from standards based grading
- READING: 15: Kate Owens. 2015. A Beginner’s Guide to Standards Based Grading. https://blogs.ams.org/matheducation/2015/11/20/a-beginners-guide-to-standards-based-grading/
    - https://blogs.ams.org/matheducation/2015/11/20/a-beginners-guide-to-standards-based-grading/
    - seems friendly enough and worth reading
    - The goal of SBG is to shift the focus of grades from a weighted average of scores earned on various assignments to a measure of mastery of individual learning targets related to the content of the course.
    -  benefits: lower stakes on each topic, great changes in OH discussions (no interest in partial credit and lost points...)
    - drawbacks:  requires a lot of student buy in (has challenges), hard to do grading in tools like Canvas, hard to balance workload for students and staff
    - 5 questions to ask before starting:
        - what are the standards for the class
        - how many standards do you want (30 in a 16 week class?)
        - how will re-attempts work logistically
        - final assessment and weight
        - scores -> standard letter grade?
- I don't have access to the other articles on current machine (need to get vpn working again...) pushed to TODOs
- pivot to ...

    - more immediate feedback with actions attached to it and building connection with a person. the 1:1 time helps to improve connections.
    - 2 instructors and 84 students... very tiny relative to the CU program...
    - 1/3 each
        - student discussion sessions occur as well in small groups.
        - instructor lead discussions occur as well. presentations by the instructor.
        - 1:1s with premade questions for instructor to interview the student
    - few statistically evident findings...
        - I feel more comfortable asking questions in this class than in many of my other classes
        - students in the student-initiated treatment indicate a significantly higher comfort level than students in the instructor-led treatment
        - students largely would prefer in person grading, students in instructor lead meeting wanted to switch out and students in student lead discussions were split on opinion
    - notes weeknesses in the experiment and lack of statistical findings
    - needs buy in and time from instructors. challenges of scale.
    - value in having different instructor do the instructor discussion vs in the lecture... although this may be a pain point for the study itself in having consistent data for review? I'm not sure I read that correctly.
- READING: Ruehr, F. and Orr, G. Interactive program demonstration as a form of student program assessment. Journal of Computing Sciences in Colleges, 18, 2 (December, 2002), 65-78

    -  good approaches will allow instructors to
        - identify those students who are best suited to continue in the curriculum
        - provide an opportunity to “rescue” those who are having trouble
        - provide feedback on the success of lectures, recitations and other instruction.
    - graded events to consider: traditional “written assignment” grading, automated and semi-automated grading, peer review, public student presentation, interactive program demonstration
    - goals of good grading/assessment process: informative, focused, fair, feasible, rewarding
        - informative: does the approach provide sufficient feedback to the student to allow them to adjust their thinking and their work?
        - focussed: to what extent does it support feedback specific to the individual student?
        - fair: does it favor one learning style or student personality over another?
        - feasible: can it be practically applied, given the constraints of class size and expectations of student and faculty (instructor) work load?
        - rewarding: will it comprise a satisfying and enriching experience, froma broader perspective, for both the student and the instructor? (Computer science is at greater risk than most disciplines of alienating students over the isolated, impersonal nature of programming; see e.g., [Dav 00].)
    - the time it takes to identify a bug, explain the issue, and explain a fix is important. it shows the challenge in time to work with bugs. 
        - PERSONAL NOTE: i've struggled with this. I prefer to pre-code things and be prepared to teach in class in a way that we don't see the bugs (I fix them in my prep time), but this does hurt students sometimes as they struggle to know what a common bug is and how they might fix it. I'm curious to explore a balance of this. In particular, have days where I intentionally am less prepared, or perhaps have students submit their bugged code, then we will debug live. This could be a fun warm up exercise to try. Let people submit a bugged thing early over some anonymous forum. Something to think about
    - find papers sighting the linked papers of: https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.5555/771322.771335 (the linked papers are old, but I bet people have taken it further)

# T: September 5, 2023
- READING: Experience Report: Standards-Based Grading at Scale in Algorithms
    - BA has Algo required in Fa19, but that means they wouldn't take it that semester... (personal thought)
    - grades should communicate to students their current command of the content and progress with respect to well-defined stan- dards [25]
    - standards require at least one timed event for each standard
    - requires student understanding this new grading format to ensure success and decrease anxiety
    - challenging time period through covid. good data about remote work.
- standup prep: busy personal life and getting caught up. Read through the pl detective and standards-based grading reports. Getting habits for the lab notebook. Finding some leads for more papers to read. Next I want to look at a peer university course layout. No blocks at this time.


# F: September 1, 2023
- I'm finally organizing the google drive folder and getting back to this work. This has been a very busy week for me and I have not succeeded in doing much - really any - research for this project. This concerns me. I'll need to re-prioritize this moving forward.
- READING Really needed to read something today. Starting with "Personalized Attention @ Scale: Talk Isn't Cheap, But It's Effective"
    - interview grading is efficient, valuable, and scalable - in intial findings
    - notes about pair programming in CS and other diciplines. take a look at these readings...
    - 15 minutes from arival to exit, but allows for 15 hours and 1 TA for 60 students... (personal TA experience, I know this is a challenge for the staff)
    - author questions:
        - did students feel that they were receiving more timely feedback on assignments than they would through traditional grading? got better feedback
        - did student feel they had permission to collaborate and research solutions to problems using outside resources? yes, high value
        - did students develop a deeper connection with their TAs through 1-on-1 meetings? yes, mostly agreed
    - 2013 - 2014 for full year including summer classes
    - 667 students. very positive feedback
    - "We use interview grading as a guard against cheating, and we feel confident letting students work together on assignments knowing that they will need to explain their solutions to a trained grader." ... personal experience, people will ride other peoples coattails in the program...
    - challenges: timing, differences in ability of the interviewer
    - futures: more CA efforts, better TA use
    - my questions:
        - how many people saw the survey over a year if only 600 people did the survey?
        - how many of our courses use interview grading today?
- working on the syllabus further
- READING "PL-Detective: A System for Teaching Programming Language Concepts"
    - Students can "create knowledge" rather than counting on an authority figure
        - Get students to collaborate with each other inside and outside the classroom
        - Get students to discover information by interacting with an experimental environment.
    - gamified with puzzles... is that gamified by the current concept and research on games in the classroom, or is that just a convenient term? Sounds like a convenient term...
    - covers: scoping (static, dynamic), type (of, assignment, equality, passiblitiy, operands, subscript), passing modes (value, name reference, result, copy-in-copy-out), evaluation order on function arguments, short circuiting.
    - experiments:
        - pl-detective for language analysis... discussion. find a probe and talk about it. encourage student collaboration.
        - pl-detective for language design... must justify design choices
    - may or may not show features to students. Evan spoke with me about this in the past and it informed by LettuceWrap tool: https://github.com/Reecesu/LettuceWrap
    -  this was at CU
    - limit count of attempts: encourages better tries by students...
        - students getting there in only 2 - 3 X the attempts it takes the isntructor
        - data suggests that students will get there as efficiently as they can even if the attempts were not limited
    - a move from principles, to experimentation
    - students that usegrades for competition needed time to get used to this method. once they understood the value and didn't focus on their grade they actually really enjoyed it.
    - SPWI: Lack viz for students, would this have value for students?



# W: August 30, 2023
- Work with Evan to confirm the IS agreement form. Had good discussions about the value and format of this document. Need to discuss a bit further about the nuance of journal vs lab notebook, but not necessary at this time as I am still learning what works best for me. The core concept is to document what I'm doing as I do it so someone can read this document and pick up where I left off in my research, while aslo understanding my various assumptions.
    - (whatever it is called) I feel that a journal allows me to be more reflective and honest with my challenges. I'm not sure that I would want that to be publically available on a github repo. Perhaps I need to split out my personal need for a journal from the technical need for a log of my research actions and decision process? Something to think about...
- Submitted official IS doc and am officially enrolled in the course.

# M: August 28, 2023
- setup this github repo
- continue work on IS form. I'm a bit concerned about the timeline, but I trust that Evan will work with me and not leave me in the cold on this. In the interim, I can begin my research and see how that better informs the IS form. I'm unsure if I can submit the proposed syllabus that Evan wants, or if I'll need to take it and reformat it to a few high level bullet points. Consider adding citations that I'm taking the format from Evan, but more correctly I believe it's from the CMU sylabus (need to check that).
- split syllabus from IS form and was better able to progress.
- plan to work with CTL to gather better resources on the teaching side, but I attended a great talk on ungrading and will be reading up on that further as part of the full study

# F: August 25, 2023
- Attended many CTL discussions. I have a lot of names to review to read further on ungrading and see if they have publications on the topic for college level teaching. the speaker suggested that to be true
- Attended in-person stand up to introduce self. I felt a bit out of place, but its the first time, so that's kind of to be expected.
- Schedule IS form review.

# R: August 24, 2023
- attended talk on justice in programming langauges with Amy Ko from Univeristy of Washington. Great points on accessibility, playfulness and inclusivity in PL. The langauge is purely functional and stream based. I've scheduled further review of her work and potentially reaching out.
- completed IS form for review.
