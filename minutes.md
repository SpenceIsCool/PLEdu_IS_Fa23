# TODO:
- look at the pair programming papers
- East & Schafe on interview grading
- Williams and Kessler [2000] on pair programming
- how many of our courses use interview grading today? slack?

- Experience Report: Standards-Based Grading at Scale in Algorithms
    - BA has Algo required in Fa19, but that means they wouldn't take it that semester... (personal thought)
    - grades should communicate to students their current command of the content and progress with respect to well-defined stan- dards [25]
    - standards require at least one timed event for each standard
    - requires student understanding this new grading format to ensure success and decrease anxiety
    - challenging time period through covid. good data about remote work.
- standup prep: busy personal life and getting caught up. Read through the pl detective and standards-based grading reports. Getting habits for the lab notebook. Finding some leads for more papers to read. Next I want to look at a peer university course layout. No blocks at this time.


# F: September 1, 2023
- I'm finally organizing the google drive folder and getting back to this work. This has been a very busy week for me and I have not succeeded in doing much - really any - research for this project. This concerns me. I'll need to re-prioritize this moving forward.
- Really needed to read something today. Starting with "Personalized Attention @ Scale: Talk Isn't Cheap, But It's Effective"
    - interview grading is efficient, valuable, and scalable - in intial findings
    - notes about pair programming in CS and other diciplines. take a look at these readings...
    - 15 minutes from arival to exit, but allows for 15 hours and 1 TA for 60 students... (personal TA experience, I know this is a challenge for the staff)
    - author questions:
        - did students feel that they were receiving more timely feedback on assignments than they would through traditional grading? got better feedback
        - did student feel they had permission to collaborate and research solutions to problems using outside resources? yes, high value
        - did students develop a deeper connection with their TAs through 1-on-1 meetings? yes, mostly agreed
    - 2013 - 2014 for full year including summer classes
    - 667 students. very positive feedback
    - "We use interview grading as a guard against cheating, and we feel confident letting students work together on assignments knowing that they will need to explain their solutions to a trained grader." ... personal experience, people will ride other peoples coattails in the program...
    - challenges: timing, differences in ability of the interviewer
    - futures: more CA efforts, better TA use
    - my questions:
        - how many people saw the survey over a year if only 600 people did the survey?
        - how many of our courses use interview grading today?
- working on the syllabus further
- reading "PL-Detective: A System for Teaching Programming Language Concepts"
    - Students can "create knowledge" rather than counting on an authority figure
        - Get students to collaborate with each other inside and outside the classroom
        - Get students to discover information by interacting with an experimental environment.
    - gamified with puzzles... is that gamified by the current concept and research on games in the classroom, or is that just a convenient term? Sounds like a convenient term...
    - covers: scoping (static, dynamic), type (of, assignment, equality, passiblitiy, operands, subscript), passing modes (value, name reference, result, copy-in-copy-out), evaluation order on function arguments, short circuiting.
    - experiments:
        - pl-detective for language analysis... discussion. find a probe and talk about it. encourage student collaboration.
        - pl-detective for language design... must justify design choices
    - may or may not show features to students. Evan spoke with me about this in the past and it informed by LettuceWrap tool: https://github.com/Reecesu/LettuceWrap
    -  this was at CU
    - limit count of attempts: encourages better tries by students...
        - students getting there in only 2 - 3 X the attempts it takes the isntructor
        - data suggests that students will get there as efficiently as they can even if the attempts were not limited
    - a move from principles, to experimentation
    - SPWI: Lack viz for students, would this have value for students?



# W: August 30, 2023
- Work with Evan to confirm the IS agreement form. Had good discussions about the value and format of this document. Need to discuss a bit further about the nuance of journal vs lab notebook, but not necessary at this time as I am still learning what works best for me. The core concept is to document what I'm doing as I do it so someone can read this document and pick up where I left off in my research, while aslo understanding my various assumptions.
    - (whatever it is called) I feel that a journal allows me to be more reflective and honest with my challenges. I'm not sure that I would want that to be publically available on a github repo. Perhaps I need to split out my personal need for a journal from the technical need for a log of my research actions and decision process? Something to think about...
- Submitted official IS doc and am officially enrolled in the course.

# M: August 28, 2023
- setup this github repo
- continue work on IS form. I'm a bit concerned about the timeline, but I trust that Evan will work with me and not leave me in the cold on this. In the interim, I can begin my research and see how that better informs the IS form. I'm unsure if I can submit the proposed syllabus that Evan wants, or if I'll need to take it and reformat it to a few high level bullet points. Consider adding citations that I'm taking the format from Evan, but more correctly I believe it's from the CMU sylabus (need to check that).
- split syllabus from IS form and was better able to progress.
- plan to work with CTL to gather better resources on the teaching side, but I attended a great talk on ungrading and will be reading up on that further as part of the full study

# F: August 25, 2023
- Attended many CTL discussions. I have a lot of names to review to read further on ungrading and see if they have publications on the topic for college level teaching. the speaker suggested that to be true
- Attended in-person stand up to introduce self. I felt a bit out of place, but its the first time, so that's kind of to be expected.
- Schedule IS form review.

# R: August 24, 2023
- attended talk on justice in programming langauges with Amy Ko from Univeristy of Washington. Great points on accessibility, playfulness and inclusivity in PL. The langauge is purely functional and stream based. I've scheduled further review of her work and potentially reaching out.
- completed IS form for review.
