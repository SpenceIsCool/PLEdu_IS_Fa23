# R: Sept 07, 2023
- READING: Continue: INTERACTIVE PROGRAM DEMONSTRATION AS A FORM OF STUDENT PROGRAM ASSESSMENT
    - Need to pickup later. stuck on page 70 (6 of 14). Should move back up the document...
    - demonstartion grading. student does the work. she asks for a 1:1 there in lab. she shows her work. the instructor points out ops for improvement. think oral exam, but code based. Can suggest extentions and changes to the spec. closed loop with ops to discuss good and bad. comes with live debugging from the student as the code is expanded. We can grade the student's flexibility/"agility" in debugging (flexible to the student's needs and ability).
    - show program robustness by suggesting new tests that show the limit of the code.
    - student is prompted with questions of the code. see if they have learned or mearly copied things (in some valid way).
    - early misunderstandings are caught and can be discussed at the class level
    - recomendation for large classes: use office hours, TAs iff they are well prepared, could be done with async video but loose the in-person value
        - PERSONAL NOTE: this paper suggests that upper divisions are small classes, but this isn't true at CU and other large isntitutions today. the paper is a bit old... I likely want to look at lower division essays as they likely already focus on LARGE classrooms.
    - methods again: written submission, automated grading, peer review, and public presentations
    - this paper focuses on developing personal rlationships between the instructor and the students...
    - THOUGHT: is it possible to have the TAs do some of the lectures and course prep to then offload this grading responsibility to the instructor? I think it's doable, but is it appropriate? Is it right?


# W: September 6, 2023
- review of papers I was interested in from standards based grading
- READING: 15: Kate Owens. 2015. A Beginner’s Guide to Standards Based Grading. https://blogs.ams.org/matheducation/2015/11/20/a-beginners-guide-to-standards-based-grading/
    - https://blogs.ams.org/matheducation/2015/11/20/a-beginners-guide-to-standards-based-grading/
    - seems friendly enough and worth reading
    - The goal of SBG is to shift the focus of grades from a weighted average of scores earned on various assignments to a measure of mastery of individual learning targets related to the content of the course.
    -  benefits: lower stakes on each topic, great changes in OH discussions (no interest in partial credit and lost points...)
    - drawbacks:  requires a lot of student buy in (has challenges), hard to do grading in tools like Canvas, hard to balance workload for students and staff
    - 5 questions to ask before starting:
        - what are the standards for the class
        - how many standards do you want (30 in a 16 week class?)
        - how will re-attempts work logistically
        - final assessment and weight
        - scores -> standard letter grade?
- I don't have access to the other articles on current machine (need to get vpn working again...) pushed to TODOs
- pivot to ...

    - more immediate feedback with actions attached to it and building connection with a person. the 1:1 time helps to improve connections.
    - 2 instructors and 84 students... very tiny relative to the CU program...
    - 1/3 each
        - student discussion sessions occur as well in small groups.
        - instructor lead discussions occur as well. presentations by the instructor.
        - 1:1s with premade questions for instructor to interview the student
    - few statistically evident findings...
        - I feel more comfortable asking questions in this class than in many of my other classes
        - students in the student-initiated treatment indicate a significantly higher comfort level than students in the instructor-led treatment
        - students largely would prefer in person grading, students in instructor lead meeting wanted to switch out and students in student lead discussions were split on opinion
    - notes weeknesses in the experiment and lack of statistical findings
    - needs buy in and time from instructors. challenges of scale.
    - value in having different instructor do the instructor discussion vs in the lecture... although this may be a pain point for the study itself in having consistent data for review? I'm not sure I read that correctly.
- READING: Ruehr, F. and Orr, G. Interactive program demonstration as a form of student program assessment. Journal of Computing Sciences in Colleges, 18, 2 (December, 2002), 65-78

    - 2002
    -  good approaches will allow instructors to
        - identify those students who are best suited to continue in the curriculum
        - provide an opportunity to “rescue” those who are having trouble
        - provide feedback on the success of lectures, recitations and other instruction.
    - graded events to consider: traditional “written assignment” grading, automated and semi-automated grading, peer review, public student presentation, interactive program demonstration
    - goals of good grading/assessment process: informative, focused, fair, feasible, rewarding
        - informative: does the approach provide sufficient feedback to the student to allow them to adjust their thinking and their work?
        - focussed: to what extent does it support feedback specific to the individual student?
        - fair: does it favor one learning style or student personality over another?
        - feasible: can it be practically applied, given the constraints of class size and expectations of student and faculty (instructor) work load?
        - rewarding: will it comprise a satisfying and enriching experience, froma broader perspective, for both the student and the instructor? (Computer science is at greater risk than most disciplines of alienating students over the isolated, impersonal nature of programming; see e.g., [Dav 00].)
    - the time it takes to identify a bug, explain the issue, and explain a fix is important. it shows the challenge in time to work with bugs. 
        - PERSONAL NOTE: i've struggled with this. I prefer to pre-code things and be prepared to teach in class in a way that we don't see the bugs (I fix them in my prep time), but this does hurt students sometimes as they struggle to know what a common bug is and how they might fix it. I'm curious to explore a balance of this. In particular, have days where I intentionally am less prepared, or perhaps have students submit their bugged code, then we will debug live. This could be a fun warm up exercise to try. Let people submit a bugged thing early over some anonymous forum. Something to think about
    - find papers sighting the linked papers of: https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.5555/771322.771335 (the linked papers are old, but I bet people have taken it further)

# T: September 5, 2023
- READING: Experience Report: Standards-Based Grading at Scale in Algorithms
    - BA has Algo required in Fa19, but that means they wouldn't take it that semester... (personal thought)
    - grades should communicate to students their current command of the content and progress with respect to well-defined stan- dards [25]
    - standards require at least one timed event for each standard
    - requires student understanding this new grading format to ensure success and decrease anxiety
    - challenging time period through covid. good data about remote work.
- standup prep: busy personal life and getting caught up. Read through the pl detective and standards-based grading reports. Getting habits for the lab notebook. Finding some leads for more papers to read. Next I want to look at a peer university course layout. No blocks at this time.


# F: September 1, 2023
- I'm finally organizing the google drive folder and getting back to this work. This has been a very busy week for me and I have not succeeded in doing much - really any - research for this project. This concerns me. I'll need to re-prioritize this moving forward.
- READING Really needed to read something today. Starting with "Personalized Attention @ Scale: Talk Isn't Cheap, But It's Effective"
    - interview grading is efficient, valuable, and scalable - in intial findings
    - notes about pair programming in CS and other diciplines. take a look at these readings...
    - 15 minutes from arival to exit, but allows for 15 hours and 1 TA for 60 students... (personal TA experience, I know this is a challenge for the staff)
    - author questions:
        - did students feel that they were receiving more timely feedback on assignments than they would through traditional grading? got better feedback
        - did student feel they had permission to collaborate and research solutions to problems using outside resources? yes, high value
        - did students develop a deeper connection with their TAs through 1-on-1 meetings? yes, mostly agreed
    - 2013 - 2014 for full year including summer classes
    - 667 students. very positive feedback
    - "We use interview grading as a guard against cheating, and we feel confident letting students work together on assignments knowing that they will need to explain their solutions to a trained grader." ... personal experience, people will ride other peoples coattails in the program...
    - challenges: timing, differences in ability of the interviewer
    - futures: more CA efforts, better TA use
    - my questions:
        - how many people saw the survey over a year if only 600 people did the survey?
        - how many of our courses use interview grading today?
- working on the syllabus further
- READING "PL-Detective: A System for Teaching Programming Language Concepts"
    - Students can "create knowledge" rather than counting on an authority figure
        - Get students to collaborate with each other inside and outside the classroom
        - Get students to discover information by interacting with an experimental environment.
    - gamified with puzzles... is that gamified by the current concept and research on games in the classroom, or is that just a convenient term? Sounds like a convenient term...
    - covers: scoping (static, dynamic), type (of, assignment, equality, passiblitiy, operands, subscript), passing modes (value, name reference, result, copy-in-copy-out), evaluation order on function arguments, short circuiting.
    - experiments:
        - pl-detective for language analysis... discussion. find a probe and talk about it. encourage student collaboration.
        - pl-detective for language design... must justify design choices
    - may or may not show features to students. Evan spoke with me about this in the past and it informed by LettuceWrap tool: https://github.com/Reecesu/LettuceWrap
    -  this was at CU
    - limit count of attempts: encourages better tries by students...
        - students getting there in only 2 - 3 X the attempts it takes the isntructor
        - data suggests that students will get there as efficiently as they can even if the attempts were not limited
    - a move from principles, to experimentation
    - SPWI: Lack viz for students, would this have value for students?



# W: August 30, 2023
- Work with Evan to confirm the IS agreement form. Had good discussions about the value and format of this document. Need to discuss a bit further about the nuance of journal vs lab notebook, but not necessary at this time as I am still learning what works best for me. The core concept is to document what I'm doing as I do it so someone can read this document and pick up where I left off in my research, while aslo understanding my various assumptions.
    - (whatever it is called) I feel that a journal allows me to be more reflective and honest with my challenges. I'm not sure that I would want that to be publically available on a github repo. Perhaps I need to split out my personal need for a journal from the technical need for a log of my research actions and decision process? Something to think about...
- Submitted official IS doc and am officially enrolled in the course.

# M: August 28, 2023
- setup this github repo
- continue work on IS form. I'm a bit concerned about the timeline, but I trust that Evan will work with me and not leave me in the cold on this. In the interim, I can begin my research and see how that better informs the IS form. I'm unsure if I can submit the proposed syllabus that Evan wants, or if I'll need to take it and reformat it to a few high level bullet points. Consider adding citations that I'm taking the format from Evan, but more correctly I believe it's from the CMU sylabus (need to check that).
- split syllabus from IS form and was better able to progress.
- plan to work with CTL to gather better resources on the teaching side, but I attended a great talk on ungrading and will be reading up on that further as part of the full study

# F: August 25, 2023
- Attended many CTL discussions. I have a lot of names to review to read further on ungrading and see if they have publications on the topic for college level teaching. the speaker suggested that to be true
- Attended in-person stand up to introduce self. I felt a bit out of place, but its the first time, so that's kind of to be expected.
- Schedule IS form review.

# R: August 24, 2023
- attended talk on justice in programming langauges with Amy Ko from Univeristy of Washington. Great points on accessibility, playfulness and inclusivity in PL. The langauge is purely functional and stream based. I've scheduled further review of her work and potentially reaching out.
- completed IS form for review.
