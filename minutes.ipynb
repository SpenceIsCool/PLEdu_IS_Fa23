    "- Today I embark on understanding what the data collection and format looks like. By understanding the number of students enrolled in the course, and enrolled in the study I have a better understanding of what that can look like in the paper.\n",
    "- Some students choose not to be a part of the study\n",
    "- self-report: The students in the study take a survey at the midterm and at the end of the semester. This survey details the blooms taxonomy and asks the students to rank their ability to perform at each level of the taxonomy. \n",
    "- data findings: We also have the students performance data to compare against the students self-reported rank.\n",
    "    - We can use this data and some algorithm to make our own assessment of the students ability\n",
    "- At the midterm we see some percentages. \n",
    "    - At the final we see better alignment from the self-report to the data findings.\n",
    "    - At the final we see lower scores as the topics covered are harder\n",
    "- We repeat the course with the proposed interview grading structure\n",
    "    - we see better percentages in all categories\n",
    "    - we don't actually see that many students reaching the \"create\" phase, but we do see more. Perhaps even within the olympic average we see some of these scores\n",
    "- the graph is the olympic average. we smooth the sides. but to get that graph, we would need lots of data on many different sizes of the class. We only have control, pilot and experiment...\n",
    "- a heat map would work better\n",
    "- so we see heat of student self reporting, data findings and some kind of corrected average (suppose that students know better than our data and we have some kind of weighting to do that adjustment)\n",
    "    - like data findings are 70% of the final score\n",
    "    - and the student data is the remaining 30%?\n",
    "- so we remove this olympic average thing...\n",
    "- To control the experiment. the same prof teaches all three terms. The prof makes limited changes. The prof uses the same reading materials and exams (or rather the exams are \"same enough\"). The support reading materials are well built in advance requiring limited changes. \n",

    "    - apply: bring some facts together to solve some problem that is new to you\n",
    "    - understand: Be able to express the facts in your own way and build your own examples potentially\n",

    "- can include demographic information: we see that women are doing better in a statistically evident way under the new model\n",
    "- Blooms Taxonomy: what is it in PL\n",
    "    - create: design and implementation of reasonably complex language with reflection/identification of the technical merits and short comings of the solution, ability to detail future work, definition in a flexible architecture to make changes easy\n",
    "    - evaluate: understanding the draw backs of the analyzed language, such as inflexible architecture for the addition of mutability in the language\n",
    "    - analyze: constructions of a language including variables and functions\n",
    "    - apply: construction of a 5 function calculator\n",
    "    - understand: explain them in your own words\n",
