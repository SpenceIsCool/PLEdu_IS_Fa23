    "    - SELF REFLECTION: curious that I myself fell victim to the trap of worrying about my grade in my independent study last semester rather then focusing on my own performance and growth. This term I have a new lease and focus on learning having seen that I can succeed in this (based on last semesters grade) and now I feel confident to focus on my learning.\n",

    "        - I'm curious though. I think that there is something to be said about better interim feedback on assessments. I think this is what Evan aims for in giving students a midterm letter grade in addition to their midterm exam score.... I like the idea we discussed earlier that we will give students only their midterm letter grade and not their exam score. We could then perform master based level grading on the midterm and worry less about partial credit. It aligns the grading philosophy to practice. Back to the current point, IT GIVES STUDENTS AN IDEA OF THEIR GRADE RELATIVE TO THE SCALE THAT THEY MAY NOT YET UNDERSTAND. This grading scale is often new to students and makes them uncomfortable. We want them to trust us and work with us and many of them do, but they still feel uncomfortable because the extrinsic reward of a grade isn't something we can take away from them within a few weeks. so we can better align their expectations to the grade. Although this then is counter-intuitive as the whole point is that grades aren't helpful for the student learning to love learning and so on.... There is something here, but I need to explore it further.\n",

    "    - yes, it doesn't require tons of explicit training\n",

    "    - e.g. LAs focus on higher level thinking and asking the students to engage and master it themselves. they ask students follow up questions. They don't really solve the problem for the student.\n",
    "    - while some content knowledge that is important, its not the end of the value add proposition from the course staff\n",

    "    - In the modern era can we have intrensic rewards for the students to do the work?\n",
    "    - In a larger classroom I'm unsure that we can have hyper flexible assignments where students engage witht he content in their personal domain of interest as the grading is not performed by the prof, so how then can we bring these funds of knowledge to play? As the interview is no longer graded for accuracy in answering the questions perfectly, but rather in the students ability to conduct the interview, growing soft skills and learnign to assess their own work, perhaps here is a good opening for these kinds of assignsments. the interview questions can focus on students own area of interest related to the current course topics....\n",

    "##### notes in meeting\n",
    "- education theory suggests that education is emotional and social\n",
    "- diologic\n",
    "- we want the students to \"conspire with you to make it work\"\n",
    "- We consider meta education theory in the classroom: explain to the students why it matters\n",
    "    - this helps you learn more\n",
    "    - and helps you know why we think this should work\n",
    "    - it also helps the students build that common vocabulary around the culture that you are trying to build\n",
    "- we balance cognition and motivation (therory)\n",
    "    - Motivation: always aiming to give more agency to the students\n",
    "    - Cognition: we get the students to build cognitive insights\n",
    "- It is then important to know the education theory to be successful in the long term and help hold your boundaries. We seek to understand the theory of why this should work\n",
    "    - interviews are referred to as \"formative assessment\" in the literature\n",
    "    - We then focus on \"improvement based\" feedback over just a letter grade\n",
    "    - this serves to help \"scaffold\" later \"compulsitory??\" and \"evidence assessments\"\n",
    "    - The goals is a safe space and \"scaffolding\" to get them ready for the later tasks\n",
    "- the data shows clearly that grading distorts motivation\n",
    "    - so maybe we don't grade the interviews at all\n",
    "    - our time is completely on getting the students to do work\n",
    "    - how do we enforce it? We sell it. We keep selling it until it works. But do it in an informed way. \n",
    "        - e.g. show them the value. Have them take a quiz w/o an interview. then do the interview, then take a different quiz.\n",
    "- so how do we get students to do the work without extrinsic motivators? I talk about Evans \"warm but firm\" and the students are going to try to push against the boundaries that we set. We need to hold the boundaries. We can only do that if we the staff really believe in the system and want to do everything that we can to make it work.\n",
    "- It's acceptable to talk about efficiency constraints: \n",
    "    - the precious resource is the experts paying attention to what the student is thinking and intervening where needed\n",
    "    - where do we spend the staff time in increasing student learning\n",
    "- DBER and Valerie Otero and the LA program at CU Boulder over time\n",
    "    - the \"funds of knowledge\" idea is great there as well. \n",
    "    - talks about \"formative assessment\" as well.\n",
    "- there are easily 600 studies on how to give effective feedback.\n",
    "- Lorrie asks: \"is every student working on the same thing?\" I didn't explain that well...\n",
    "- Lectrures: you find the patterns and collect instances of the challenges. \n",
    "- it is sometimes troublesome for students to identify what they don't know.\n",
    "    - its more productive to identify and build on what they do know\n",
    "    - \"learning progressions\" are sometimes the opposite in the literature as they focus on teaching students what they don't know, but in the end it serves as the base to help us know the scaffolding and how to build students ability based on what they already know. \n",
    "    - conversations with staff, understand what they do get stuck on and what they do know.\n",
    "- We can learn the most from seeing the examples that students come up with\n",
    "    - I saw this in my Community Based Design course where the graduate students lead about 90% of the lectures and the instructor was there to guide the topics and highlight those key things if we miss them.\n",
    "    - what were the students trying to learn?\n",
    "    - where did they get stuck?\n",
    "    - Who said what that got us past being stuck?\n",
    "    - We try to be less \"procedural\" and more \"substantive\"\n",
    "- Build a habit of substance and affirmation in your self and the course staff, say: \"I wee what you are trying to do with foo, have you tried bar\"\n",
    "    - yourself and the staff...\n",
    "    - they get habits over time and come to the course with those habits\n",
    "    - we build examples of good things like how the students get those \"ah-ha\"s\n",
    "    - we build the good habits, those examples that tend to help students learn the particular topic\n",
    "    - we share those ah-hahs and help them have those discussions\n",
    "- Consider collecting insights from the interviews and share back the anonymous versions in class.\n",
    "    - state what it taught you as the instructor\n",
    "        - this humility may be uncomfortable for the prof\n",
    "        - but it's shown to work\n",
    "    - great for you to SHOW that YOU LEARNED SOMETHING!\n",
    "    - while this may make the student feel singled out or awkward it often helps the student feel validated, recognized and achieving. You could directly quote them\n",
    "        - thinking about how Evan does interviews. We are specific in our examples, not generic.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### retro\n",
    "- for this meeting it would have been better for me to give a full picture of the task I want to achieve. I left a lot of gaps in the idea and that seemed to confuse Lorrie. Lesson learned for the future\n",
    "- Lorrie demonstrated her ideas as we went. She would confirm what I understood and celebrate it before moving to a way to improve the idea. This shows a good psych trick."
