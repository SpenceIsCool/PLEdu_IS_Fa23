    "- background:\n",
    "    - In our analysis of the existing course structure against the literature, we believe that one weak point of the existing course structure lies in the execution of the grading interviews. The grading interviews have begun to fail our students in that they are hosted by inadequately prepared interviewers in time windows that are too small to host an effective interview relative to the students common level of mastery with the material. Many institutions have implemented staff-grading interviews at small scale for upper divisions and large scale for lower division courses. Many schools have also implemented reflective grading for a small scale classroom. However, there is a gap in the literature on how to support our large scale upper division classrooms with in-person oral assessments like staff-interviews, or with the use of reflective grading. This paper proposes a new model of interview grading completed in a peer-to-peer model with reflective grading procedures. This paper gathers data on how students might succeed or fail in the new proposed structure based on themes observed from past students performance in the existing structure. \n",

    "    - What is the problem? the course is hard to staff to host interviews effectively and the interviews currently prioritize correct answers above learning in a course that requires learning for success on the exams which account for a large portion of the student graded resulting in unethical behavior by students\n",
    "    - Why is it hard? this is hard to remedy as we want to keep giving students an exceptional learning experience. we don't want to \"water down\" the course. We believe the current course structure is what is best for the students to \"learn by doing\". we can't hire the right people. we don't ahve enough time. the time isn't being used effectively.\n",

However, this is not what I was envisioning and I think that this is in conflict with where I need to take the study in my remaining time.\n",
    "    - My vision was a brief lecture, followed by actual pair interviews lead by a document that gives each student a question to try, some hints for the interviewer to help guide the interview. Some grading criteria to peer grade. We then debrief the exercise with a few guided questions to understand what the participants experienced in the interview. Since it is a group discussion, it's best if these questions are phrased to encourage collaborative answering.\n",

This is why I think this is the piece that is worth solving next. And doing experiments.\n",

    "    - What is my motivation?\n",
    "    - It's not why is this a problem, it's what is the problem\n",
    "    - I need to be very specific about the challenge at hand, my motivation to resolve the challenge and ???my direction??? I think my direction should be saved for \"what is your approach\" but it also seems relevant to being very specific about the challenge at hand.\n",
    "- What is my motivation?\n",
    "    - Fall 2022 was perhaps the hardest semester of CSCI 3155 that I've had.\n",
    "    - The course had a 160 students by the end of the term.\n",
    "    - The students stores of knowledge were insufficient for success.\n",
    "    - the students had not been challenged sufficiently in previous courses and were not prepared for this level of rigor. This course is always hard and \"weird\" in that it is not a traditional lecture format, but this semester came with more significant push-back and giving up from the students (from my perspective)\n",
    "        - I'm almost tempted to center on that factor impacting students performance, but I don't believe that is reasonable for my current goals. I think that is too much of a distraction. I think that would be too large of a pivot. Like it is a part of the problem. And it is benefited by the proprosal in that we would have better and more honest feedback at each stage of each lab that should be more honest to help us better pivot the course as needed based on student ability.\n",
    "    - I latched onto the size of the class as the problem, but I don't know that is accurate.\n",
    "    - Additionally our course staff was unprepared to do the work with many of my co-TAs not able to complete the labs on their own in a reasonable amount of time (varied by TA), and our grading staff looking to me to not only organize their grading methods, but also to explain the core learning goals of the lab and the questions posed at interviews.\n",

    "        - more broadly, so many students take a degree in CS due to the promise of stable high income and not b/c they want to learn to code or solve problems using code. One participant states \"I don't like to code\", and that participant will do what it takes to get an A. Accordingly they didn't enjoy the course and they didn't learn much as they behaved unethically.\n",
    "    - the staff is not trained well. some lack technical ability. some lack teaching ability. their personal goals often don't align to what we need them to do this semester to best enable student success.\n",

    "    - students need to learn something or else they won't actually meet those finanacial and prestigue goals.\n",
    "    - the course covers \"powerful ideas\" [Papert] which transend the CS and Engineering space and have value to so many domains in how someone might conceptualize and solve a \"hard\" problem. or even an easy problem in some new way. that innovation to understand inductive reasoning can help change their field of interest in a way that is very valuable to so many other people that we haven't even met or concieved of down the line.\n",

    "> In this paper, we present an approach to lift on-demand analysis to higher-order languages. Specifically, our approach bootstraps an on-demand call graph construction by leveraging a pair of on-demand data flow analyses. Static analysis is increasingly applied to find subtle bugs or prove deep properties in large, industrial code bases. To effectively do this at scale, analyzers need to both resolve function calls in a precise manner (i.e., construct a precise call graph) and examine only the relevant portion of the program (i.e., be on-demand). A strawman strategy to this problem is to use fast, approximate, whole-program call graph construction algorithms. However, this strategy is generally not adequate for modern languages like JavaScript that rely heavily on higher-order features, such as callbacks and closures, where scalable approximations often introduce unacceptable imprecision. This strategy also limits increasingly sophisticated on-demand analyses, which scale by analyzing only parts of a program as needed: the scalability advantages of an on-demand analysis may be thwarted by the need to construct a whole-program call graph. The key insight of this paper is that existing on-demand data flow analyses can themselves be applied in a black-box manner to construct call graphs on demand. We propose a soundness condition for the existing on-demand analyses with respect to partial call graphs, formalize our algorithm as an abstract domain combinator, and prove it sound in Isabelle/HOL. Furthermore, we evaluate a prototype implementation of the resulting on-demand call graph construction algorithm for a subset of JavaScript (using the Synchronized Push-Down Systems framework as the underlying data flow analysis) on benchmarks making heavy use of higher-order functions.\n",

Such a technique could help bring the power of server-based static analyses to integrated development environments (IDEs), updating their results live as the code is modified. Compositionality is key for this scenario, as it enables reuse of already-computed analysis results for unmodified code. Previous techniques for interactive static analysis either lack compositionality, cannot express arbitrary abstract domains, or are not from-scratch consistent. We present demanded summarization, the first algorithm for incremental compositional analysis in arbitrary abstract domains which guarantees from-scratch consistency. Our approach analyzes individual procedures using a recent technique for demanded analysis, computing summaries on demand for procedure calls. A dynamically-updated summary dependency graph enables precise result invalidation after program edits, and the algorithm is carefully designed to guarantee from-scratch-consistent results after edits, even in the presence of recursion and in arbitrary abstract domains. We formalize our technique and prove soundness, termination, and from-scratch consistency. An experimental evaluation of a prototype implementation on synthetic and real-world program edits provides evidence for the feasibility of this theoretical framework, showing potential for major performance benefits over non-demanded compositional analyses.\n",

Over time, this has led to higher enrollment in courses, limiting the units of one-on-one support available to students, prompting a change in methods to teach effectively at larger scales. Accordingly, many courses have gone to focus on teaching at scale with less regard for the learning value to each student, or continuing their previous teaching methods with limited exploration in adaptation to scale. For each choice, we observe an unwanted trend in unethical behavior from students as we degrade the resources and value posed to students paying for in-person university courses compared against the value they might derive from educational alternatives such as asynchronous or semi-synchronous learning environments. For this paper, we propose that students do not commit acts of academic dishonesty because they are malicious beings. Students commit these acts because they feel that they do not have adequate resources to perform some task through honest means.

In contrast, fewer than half of respondents had explicit partner goals; partner goals were often not assessed. Also, most respondents judged reaching student goals as more important than partner goals, with about 25% of respondents seeing benefits to partners as only a bonus. Faculty justified their choices by appealing to their mission as educators. Yet for a nontrivial partnership commitment under condition of scarce resources, the community partner may be seen as being taken advantage of, which may explain why some respondents have difficulty finding or keeping partners. Further, faculty may not accomplish civic duty goals, since students may tacitly learn that community organizations' needs are secondary. To aid faculty in making decisions and better integrating community partners' needs, we offer advice from survey respondents.\n",

The study combined data from nine institutions from both Western Europe and North America and included 272 different classes with 49,710 student enrollments. These classes were encoded using ACM curriculum guidelines and combined with the enrollment data to build a hierarchical statistical model of factors affecting student choice. Our model shows which elective topics are less popular with all students (including fundamentals of programming languages and parallel and distributed computing), and which elective topics are more popular with women students (including mathematical and statistical foundations, human computer interaction and society, ethics, and professionalism). Understanding which classes appeal to different students can help departments gain insight of student choices and develop programs accordingly. Additionally, these choices can also help departments explore whether some students are less likely to choose certain classes than others, indicating potential barriers to participation in computing.\n",

A reliable social presence importance composite variable was created from nine survey questions. Across all demographic categories, respondents report social presence is important and that in-person instruction is easier to accomplish it. Being able to safely sense and engage with peers socially and intellectually is both perceived as important and easier in in-person classes. Students were more likely to prefer the in-person setting for social expression, getting to know other students, and feeling an obligation to engage. A small majority of students prefer in-person learning to remote learning, with 66% finding it easier to learn in person and 47% stating that they would take all classes in person if given the option. Consistent with prior research, students older than 24 showed greater preference for SRL instruction (p<.001).\n",

    "2. While this knowledge is important, reform is unlikely to occur if innovations are only used experimentally; we need to understand why faculty sustain their use. To that end, this study draws on data from a two-phase project in the U.S. to examine why computer science (CS) faculty continue or discontinue use of a practice after the initial trial.\n",

From these results, in the second phase, we collected survey data from 821 faculty at 595 institutions. In this paper, we briefly discuss qualitative results, and then use quantitative data to model what impact the following factors have on sustaining use: achieved benefits for students' performance and their satisfaction in CS, the perception of usefulness to the instructor, student feedback, and ease of use. Results indicate that benefits to students' performance are paramount in predicting continued use. We also explore why faculty abandon a practice, finding that the decision often relates to not achieving desired outcomes and, in some cases, students not making a good faith effort to do their part. We observed that the latter experience can engender negative beliefs about students-that they have, at best, a passive attitude toward their learning. Implications for encouraging sustained usage of innovative teaching techniques are discussed.\n",

    "        2. While it is important that I know all of the background and use that as the basis for my research, I don't know that I need to have so many build up slides. I think that I could cut that down to one slide per concept and I can cut this down a LOT in the paper. I think a great goal for next week is to rework the background section to shrink it to the most relevant information while also reading and adding info about how to \"resource\" students.\n",

    "    - some great ideas in writing so far. I chose to write at the C4C and I like it here. There is food when I want a break and there are people around me which sometimes helps me to do more work. I don't get too distracted in this environment.\n",
    "    - block: The experiment section had: enrollment, performance, and satisfaction sections before based on the previous research questions for hypothetical results. I noted that I should write up sections for the new questions: peer interactions, performance, ethics. But I'm not sure how to write that up. Before I write it, I think I need to understand why I had the old section.\n",
    "        - it might not be relevant aymore\n",
    "        - the time spent writing and thinking about this will be valuable to me knowing what I will write if it does turn out to be relevant still\n",
    "        - enrollment: describes the data aobut who was enrolled and what people did\n",
    "        - performance: states the results from students suggesting their performance\n",
    "            - I think this could still be relevant and it helps to build the future experiment and frame it as \"legitimate\" research in my mind. I think I can keep the performance section but frame it as what we will collect, not wha t we did collect, then in results we can talk about what success or failure would look like.\n",
    "        - success: describes the data that we will collect from students\n",
    "        - for now, I think this isn't relevant, but I should take a note to go back to the old paper if I later want to adapt the paper to propose the future study rather than discussing the current study.\n",
    "        - I should for sure note int he student reflection space the kinds of question that we will ask students about bloom! feels forced right now, but I think it's worth the refactor.\n",
    "        - as expected it was a bit challenging to cut that section\n",
    "    - not ready for intro or conclusion, but I feel good about the abstract.\n",
    "    - spent half an hour on the costs section and kept getting distracted\n",
    "    - deciding to cut the 'resources' section. I think it's important to my end story, but I don't understand it well enough at this time to write about it intelligently.\n",
    "    - I spent a LOT of time writing, and I don't love the end result as I see how many gaps there are between what it is that I want to demonstrate with my research and what I can actually state today. Having said that, I feel good about this paper as it stands. It is a solid paper and I look forward to my next iteration.\n",

I spent most of the time learning about her path to PhD as someone with a deep background in programming language development and learning tools (Scratch). We agreed that her main focus for research does not align well to my current research project but she did recommend Lecia Barker as a researcher at CU focused on CS education research in higher education environments and also noted that there is a course in INFO that is using interview grading that I might want to plug into (I need to follow up on both of these points)."

In general for PPL if I'm doing that work, I really don't want to start and I get better work completed if I do the work in one sitting as opposed to many many sittings. Could also be my DFC day.\n",

    "            - It's lower than evaluate (justifying decisions and being able to critical assess alternate solutions to a problem)\n",

    "                    - This doesn't align to what I would expect of the student. So is it right?\n",
    "            - I wouldn't say that these students are exactly one category or the other, but I think that they represent multiple categories. I could split characteristics of them into multiple personas. But then they are idealized personas and less grounded in the reality that students are complex creatures with complex methods of decision making and learning ability. I could start doing that split, then I could look at which falls more where? Then make them the different personas.\n",
    "            - Interviews: Understand: The matter of how they approach the interviews appears to be largely understand. They seek to know the questions. They seek to answer it in their own words. They are not entering the interview with a deep enough knowledge of the lab to answer questions of a related topic which they have not personally seen before.\n",

    "                - P15: on occasions they were doing the lab and carrying someone. can clearly articulate there growing challenge in the course. lab 6 made sense. has a goal that feels more intrinsic which in theory leads to better performance...\n",
    "                - P58: was transparent about their methods. challenges in being ask to code something quickly. They also clearly articulate their challenges. They felt that they might fail the course by the end of the semester. This could be an indication of lower taxonomy, but also people are bad at self-assessment in general and it could be the persons bias and self-image.\n",
    "            -  I have more interviews this evening. Let's bring that into the picture. For now I'll treat them as a single persona: \"apply\"\n",

    "- this weeks goal: By March 1 I will update the experiment and results sections of the paper based on my process and findings in interviewing past students.\n",
    "- today's goal and how it aligns to the goal of the week: draft the experiment section\n",
    "- notes:\n",
    "    - copy off the current section with a date so I can easily go back and see the change and it has some record of the changes over sprints this way as well.\n",
    "    - read the current section/scratch out current ideas quickly\n",
    "    - So I am able to get in the information about how I collected data in interviews, but I don't understand how this ties to the old data on what I propose for a method of peer interview grading. Do I scrap that? Do I work hard to integrate them some how and \"make it up\". I feel like I am working on two disconnected research studies at the moment. One is an analysis of student sentiment and behavior and the other is a recommendation for a path forward based on that analysis. I should be able to join them. I'm guessing that I should join them. I'm not yet certain what that looks like.\n",
    "    - One note that I've been carrying around on my calendar from design for creativity and learning, but need to get into this project:: if working with a vulnerable group of people, start with a less vulnerable population. Document and learn from interacting with the less vulnerable population and use that knowledge to suggest how to better design your experiment with the target group. I think this would have been valuable for me to do. I could have spoken with friends in the graduate program about ethics prior to conducting the interviews with past undergraduate students in a way that I am recording their actions and choice of words. I can't change the past, but this is something to keep in mind for future studies. I think that this study has gone fine but I was caught off guard by what some of the participants have exposed and I had to make hard decisions on the fly during the interviews (which I handled well but it would have been nice to have more practice in advance).\n",
    "    - discussion with peer: make the personas. you have ways to add more people, but for now just build out the two personas and then only suggest the third if you have time/actively seek the third later on.\n",
    "    - discussion with Christian: writing each section of the paper separately and getting feedback on it is great. You can't get most people to read your full paper in one go anyway. When you go work on some things (reading, interviews, so on), you had a reason to do it that related back to the goal so it's going to fit back in somehow. You might just have to spend time thinking about it before it happens.\n",
    "    - slack discussion with Evan: I was curious about how to best balance the new method and results form interviewing past students with the previous content about my proposed method for peer interview. From his feedback, I infer: be expansive at first, then revise by what Thomas Edison said: “The most valuable of all talents is that of never using two words when one will do.”\n",
    "- did we meet the goal?\n",
    "    - I made progress toward the goal in understanding that personas can represent these students being interviewed and I've better understood the data from my interviews with these past students."

    "- So I'm thinking about stress for students and how we can help students be less stressed in this environment where the goal is individualized and thereby not as concrete as they may be used to. It's not about some bare minimum institutional requirement, but about the students challenging themselves and growing relative to their baseline. So how could we do this?\n",
    "- I think a lot about the discussion with Lorrie to identify what students have succeeded with and using that as the building block/scaffolding for challenging them in other things. We focus on what they do well rather than focusing on where they need improvement.\n",
    "- how does that work in a peer interview where things are asynchronous.\n",
    "- we could build up large GRE style question sets that get harder as the student progresses based on past performance, but that A takes a lot of work and B is part of a sumative assessment practice and not necessarily a good idea for the interview that we wish to keep formative\n",
    "- Consider the current workflow recommendation\n",
    "    - students select a time to do the interview\n",
    "    - **they meet and review what they learned in the lab** (perhaps guided by some inspirational thing)\n",
    "    - they download the question bank and take turns answering it\n",
    "    - they assess their own performance on an un-grading scale\n",
    "- **they meet and review what they learned in the lab**\n",
    "    - at this step we could give them some kind of overview of the lab\n",
    "        - like here are the topics from the lab\n",
    "        - rank how you feel about the topics\n",
    "        - then some of the topics link well so we could have question series based on what students think they know best\n",
    "        - perhaps 4 paths of the interview for 4 best knowledge sets\n",
    "        - they ask 3 questions and build on each other in a way that builds on expertise in the one topic in order to answer the next topic.\n",

The feel of the tool could help with that low stress environment.

I think this is what Evan aims for in giving students a midterm letter grade in addition to their midterm exam score.... I like the idea we discussed earlier that we will give students only their midterm letter grade and not their exam score. We could then perform master based level grading on the midterm and worry less about partial credit. It aligns the grading philosophy to practice. Back to the current point, IT GIVES STUDENTS AN IDEA OF THEIR GRADE RELATIVE TO THE SCALE THAT THEY MAY NOT YET UNDERSTAND. This grading scale is often new to students and makes them uncomfortable. We want them to trust us and work with us and many of them do, but they still feel uncomfortable because the extrinsic reward of a grade isn't something we can take away from them within a few weeks. so we can better align their expectations to the grade. Although this then is counter-intuitive as the whole point is that grades aren't helpful for the student learning to love learning and so on....

    "    * there will be a few questions that exists as \"remember\"\n",
    "    * so I really have a metric of students ability to remember or analyze and I don't know their ability to evaluate or create based on the summative assessment\n",
    "    * evaluate should be addressed in their interviews as they are asked about room for imrpovement in their existing solutions from the lab\n",
    "    * create can come up as they do the lab and solve those stretch problems, or complete the final lab 7/mini project\n",
    "    * Can I really weight the students performance?\n",
    "    * Is bloom even the right thing to ask the students to self assess on?\n",
    "    * I could.... \n",
    "        * review the student self assessment of mastery of the material\n",
    "        * and compare this to the exam score\n",
    "        * In this world where I get to make up the data...\n",
    "        * I expect that students which \n",
    "            * engage in the peer to peer interviews\n",
    "            * have a positive opion of the course\n",
    "            * and rank themselves as having a \"create\" level mastery\n",
    "            * are more accurate in their assessment of the course - their exam score better matches what they self report as their understanding level\n",
    "        * more correctly, students that take the peer to peer interviews have a statistcally significant ability to assess their mastery level in a way that does align to their performance on the exam (infered - better understanding of the course content would be a higher score on the exam and inverse is true as well)\n",
    "        * while students that took the TA interviews are more like a random guess in assessing their own understanding\n",
    "* the cool thing that may not happen in the real data, is to see that students that take the peer to peer interviews also perform statistically better on the exams...\n",
    "* so back to weighting the student self reported understanding level (SRUL)?\n",
    "    * I have their SRUL\n",
    "    * I have their exam grade\n",
    "    * I could do a scatter plot...\n",
    "    * that would be the right viz for the correlation of the performance and listed rank\n",
    "    * But I don't know that I could weight their true understanding level based on this\n",
    "        * like yeah, the exam grade on a curve is A - F (6 point scale) and bloom is also a 6 point scale, but the nature of that curve is that it will bring down the scores in a significant way. But maybe that is okay? But again, the exams end at analyze... But a student that couldn't create really couldn't analyze or perform well on the exam - as is a common criticism of bloom being so linear where human learning is not....\n",
    "    * so their raw score on the exam average at 70 or 50 or something is one data point\n",
    "    * I would likely curve that score to an average that is \"good\"\n",
    "    * I could then use this to weight their self assessment up or down. Maybe a 50/50.\n",
    "    * Based on history I would expect a something bimodal in the final results on evaluate and apply for the core peer to peer and something more like analyze and understand for the TA interviews"

As the interview is no longer graded for accuracy in answering the questions perfectly, but rather in the students ability to conduct the interview, growing soft skills and learnign to assess their own work, perhaps here is a good opening for these kinds of assignsments. the interview questions can focus on students own area of interest related to the current course topics....\n",
