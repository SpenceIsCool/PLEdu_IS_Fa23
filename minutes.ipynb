    "### NOTES\n",
    "- So I'm thinking about stress for students and how we can help students be less stressed in this environment where the goal is individualized and thereby not as concrete as they may be used to. It's not about some bare minimum institutional requirement, but about the students challenging themselves and growing relative to their baseline. So how could we do this?\n",
    "- I think a lot about the discussion with Lorrie to identify what students have succeeded with and using that as the building block/scaffolding for challenging them in other things. We focus on what they do well rather than focusing on where they need improvement.\n",
    "- how does that work in a peer interview where things are asynchronous.\n",
    "- we could build up large GRE style question sets that get harder as the student progresses based on past performance, but that A takes a lot of work and B is part of a sumative assessment practice and not necessarily a good idea for the interview that we wish to keep formative\n",
    "- Consider the current workflow recommendation\n",
    "    - students select a time to do the interview\n",
    "    - **they meet and review what they learned in the lab** (perhaps guided by some inspirational thing)\n",
    "    - they download the question bank and take turns answering it\n",
    "    - they assess their own performance on an un-grading scale\n",
    "- **they meet and review what they learned in the lab**\n",
    "    - at this step we could give them some kind of overview of the lab\n",
    "        - like here are the topics from the lab\n",
    "        - rank how you feel about the topics\n",
    "        - then some of the topics link well so we could have question series based on what students think they know best\n",
    "        - perhaps 4 paths of the interview for 4 best knowledge sets\n",
    "        - they ask 3 questions and build on each other in a way that builds on expertise in the one topic in order to answer the next topic.\n",
    "        - but this is a big rework of the questions. currently our questions are set as topics for each lab and they don't all have obvious ways to link together. Will need to look at each of the 6 lab interviews and questions as they exist today. NOTE that today's questions are currently privileged information, so I can't post them here, only rework them to new forms here\n",
    "    - could be a rework of \"they download the question bank and take turns answering it\"\n",
    "        - we could not even ask them questions\n",
    "        - we could ask them to assess their knowledge on the lab as is?\n",
    "        - we could ask them to take the in-class exercise as a take home pair exercise and assess their learning of this\n",
    "            - that has an advantage as we are increasing student time for interviews that stress needs to come from somewhere and bringing it from these exercises could be good. It could give more time in lecture to ask questions about the exercise... to bring to lecture \"hey, I did well on x, but I don't get z. I see how they are related but I don't get it yet. Can we talk about z more in terms of x?\"\n",
    "- they assess their own performance on an un-grading scale\n",
    "    - the un-grading scale is still grading and is still lumping students into categories\n",
    "    - we could drop that concept and have them instead do the write up only on what they learned, where they can improve and what we can do to help them and what they can do for themselves\n",
    "    - although, I don't think it's our current goal to fully un-grade the class so this scale is a good enough place to be and having it in the student write-up is a good idea to help them adapt to our grading expectations\n",

To add tech it can be a easy website that asks the question, but then students can click buttons to get hints. Those hints are delivered in some order...\n",
    "- the students could take turns on being the question answer, but then they would be expected to ask their peer about the question before taking the hint for the question. the first hint will typically be some rewording of the question with a hint. Generally the goal is not to change the questions that we are using, but to provide a richer student experience looking at the questions without a TA in the loop. The feel of the tool could help with that low stress environment. Thinking about it like the discussion of Loom today, we can have things in the tool that evoke the emotion that we want the user to feel (like how loom makes things feel like its okay for a video to be transient and unpolished, just do it and move on), here we want to give the students the feeling that they are good at something in the material and that they are capable of doing more.\n",

Its designed as formative that students do it and get credit (mostly) but then often doesn't have a ton of feedback built into it - in my experience.\n",

I like the idea we discussed earlier that we will give students only their midterm letter grade and not their exam score. We could then perform master based level grading on the midterm and worry less about partial credit. It aligns the grading philosophy to practice. Back to the current point, IT GIVES STUDENTS AN IDEA OF THEIR GRADE RELATIVE TO THE SCALE THAT THEY MAY NOT YET UNDERSTAND. This grading scale is often new to students and makes them uncomfortable. We want them to trust us and work with us and many of them do, but they still feel uncomfortable because the extrinsic reward of a grade isn't something we can take away from them within a few weeks. so we can better align their expectations to the grade. Although this then is counter-intuitive as the whole point is that grades aren't helpful for the student learning to love learning and so on....

    "- It was good to have the break, I thought about this project a lot but I didn't perform any formal research on the matter\n",
    "- I meet with Lorrie today and Jessica tomorrow\n",
    "- In preparation for Lorries meeting, read \"<a href=\"https://github.com/csci3155-course-repos/csci3155_spring2022_private/tree/master/projects/project3_root\"> Ambitious Teaching and Equitable Assessment </a>\" and consider my questions w.r.t. my work on interview grading of students.\n",
    "    - support learning and not the teaching systems\n",
    "    - testing isn't equitable\n",
    "    - In the modern era can we have intrensic rewards for the students to do the work?\n",
    "    - In a larger classroom I'm unsure that we can have hyper flexible assignments where students engage witht he content in their personal domain of interest as the grading is not performed by the prof, so how then can we bring these funds of knowledge to play? As the interview is no longer graded for accuracy in answering the questions perfectly, but rather in the students ability to conduct the interview, growing soft skills and learnign to assess their own work, perhaps here is a good opening for these kinds of assignsments. the interview questions can focus on students own area of interest related to the current course topics....\n",
    "    - what is this note about a \"lack of high quality instruction\"? Oh, it's like a fliped classroom and the idea to let students do it on their terms and make their own vocab and such\n",
    "    - values: peer assessment and focus on how to improve learning, not penalizing students for not knowing the things that they dont know, encouraging students to discuss things that are hard in their own words with low stakes but still encourage them to grow, \n",
    "    - feedback must be: \"\"\"\n",
    "        - focused on the task and learning targets; that is, detailed and narrative, not evaluative and graded;\n",
    "        - delivered in a way that is supportive and aligned with the learner’s progress;\n",
    "        - delivered at a time when the learner can benefit from it; and\n",
    "        - delivered to a receptive learner who has the self-efficacy needed to respond.\"\"\"\n",

    "#### Meeting with Lorrie\n",
    "##### Prep\n",
    "- Thank you for taking the time to meet with me\n",
    "- I know you have a meeting at 3, if we find that we are being productive are you able to go a bit over?\n",
    "- Your paper notes the policies that lead to where we are today and the misalignment of student learning goals and the policy. this impacts university students. \n",
    "- I'm deeply interested in how we bring these ideas to a large classroom\n",
    "- pitch the interview grading.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### notes in meeting\n",
    "- education theory suggests that education is emotional and social\n",
    "- diologic\n",
    "- we want the students to \"conspire with you to make it work\"\n",
    "- We consider meta education theory in the classroom: explain to the students why it matters\n",
    "    - this helps you learn more\n",
    "    - and helps you know why we think this should work\n",
    "    - it also helps the students build that common vocabulary around the culture that you are trying to build\n",
    "- we balance cognition and motivation (therory)\n",
    "    - Motivation: always aiming to give more agency to the students\n",
    "    - Cognition: we get the students to build cognitive insights\n",
    "- It is then important to know the education theory to be successful in the long term and help hold your boundaries. We seek to understand the theory of why this should work\n",
    "    - interviews are referred to as \"formative assessment\" in the literature\n",
    "    - We then focus on \"improvement based\" feedback over just a letter grade\n",
    "    - this serves to help \"scaffold\" later \"compulsitory??\" and \"evidence assessments\"\n",
    "    - The goals is a safe space and \"scaffolding\" to get them ready for the later tasks\n",
    "- the data shows clearly that grading distorts motivation\n",
    "    - so maybe we don't grade the interviews at all\n",
    "    - our time is completely on getting the students to do work\n",
    "    - how do we enforce it? We sell it. We keep selling it until it works. But do it in an informed way. \n",
    "        - e.g. show them the value. Have them take a quiz w/o an interview. then do the interview, then take a different quiz.\n",
    "- so how do we get students to do the work without extrinsic motivators? I talk about Evans \"warm but firm\" and the students are going to try to push against the boundaries that we set. We need to hold the boundaries. We can only do that if we the staff really believe in the system and want to do everything that we can to make it work.\n",
    "- It's acceptable to talk about efficiency constraints: \n",
    "    - the precious resource is the experts paying attention to what the student is thinking and intervening where needed\n",
    "    - where do we spend the staff time in increasing student learning\n",
    "- DBER and Valerie Otero and the LA program at CU Boulder over time\n",
    "    - the \"funds of knowledge\" idea is great there as well. \n",
    "    - talks about \"formative assessment\" as well.\n",
    "- there are easily 600 studies on how to give effective feedback.\n",
    "- Lorrie asks: \"is every student working on the same thing?\" I didn't explain that well...\n",
    "- Lectrures: you find the patterns and collect instances of the challenges. \n",
    "- it is sometimes troublesome for students to identify what they don't know.\n",
    "    - its more productive to identify and build on what they do know\n",
    "    - \"learning progressions\" are sometimes the opposite in the literature as they focus on teaching students what they don't know, but in the end it serves as the base to help us know the scaffolding and how to build students ability based on what they already know. \n",
    "    - conversations with staff, understand what they do get stuck on and what they do know.\n",
    "- We can learn the most from seeing the examples that students come up with\n",
    "    - I saw this in my Community Based Design course where the graduate students lead about 90% of the lectures and the instructor was there to guide the topics and highlight those key things if we miss them.\n",
    "    - what were the students trying to learn?\n",
    "    - where did they get stuck?\n",
    "    - Who said what that got us past being stuck?\n",
    "    - We try to be less \"procedural\" and more \"substantive\"\n",
    "- Build a habit of substance and affirmation in your self and the course staff, say: \"I wee what you are trying to do with foo, have you tried bar\"\n",
    "    - yourself and the staff...\n",
    "    - they get habits over time and come to the course with those habits\n",
    "    - we build examples of good things like how the students get those \"ah-ha\"s\n",
    "    - we build the good habits, those examples that tend to help students learn the particular topic\n",
    "    - we share those ah-hahs and help them have those discussions\n",
    "- Consider collecting insights from the interviews and share back the anonymous versions in class.\n",
    "    - state what it taught you as the instructor\n",
    "        - this humility may be uncomfortable for the prof\n",
    "        - but it's shown to work\n",
    "    - great for you to SHOW that YOU LEARNED SOMETHING!\n",
    "    - while this may make the student feel singled out or awkward it often helps the student feel validated, recognized and achieving. You could directly quote them\n",
    "        - thinking about how Evan does interviews. We are specific in our examples, not generic.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### retro\n",
    "- for this meeting it would have been better for me to give a full picture of the task I want to achieve. I left a lot of gaps in the idea and that seemed to confuse Lorrie. Lesson learned for the future\n",
    "- Lorrie demonstrated her ideas as we went. She would confirm what I understood and celebrate it before moving to a way to improve the idea. This shows a good psych trick."
