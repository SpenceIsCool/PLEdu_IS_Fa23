    "    - what is the basis?\n",
    "    - fundamentally: a diversity of learning styles\n",
    "        - 2 camps\n",
    "        - seeing and coying examples (most classes bias to this)\n",
    "        - learn by doing and exploring on your own\n",
    "        - everyone needs a bit of both regardless of their preferences\n",
    "    - project based wanted to really support these hands on learners\n",
    "    - the course is designed to support the first group, then the project are to explore\n",
    "    - the project can tinker and learn and is often less supported in a standard classroom setting\n",
    "    - release the project at the same time that you cover the material rather than staggered. \n",
    "        - has an aspect of active learning.\n",
    "    - the lecture drives the discussion based on what the students want to learn. if there is learning that is needed for the project based learner, then we prod it early on. It has taken Evan time to learn how to do this well. \n",
    "        - really good lecture based learners really struggle (I can second this from my own experience)\n",
    "            - in particular, it takes students time to learn how to adapt to this way of learning and they tend to be highly resistive at first\n",
    "        - and for the hands on learner this really clicks for them, but they often barely get by in other classes\n",
    "    - NOTE: haven't evaluated it as rigorously as Evan would like.\n",
    "- Response: what is the ideal for formative vs sumative assessments?\n",
    "    - my intent is that everything except the exams are formative\n",
    "    - in a perfect world we would put 100% of the grade on the midterm and final\n",
    "        - today students struggle that even 45% of the grade is weighted to exams as the exams are only a few hours of the semester\n",
    "        - but thats Evans point in the learning: 90% of the time is formative learning and 10% to the exam\n",
    "        - We note that many people are deadline driven, so having the deadlines and having grades on the formative learning is valuable in the big picture\n",
    "    - ultimately what we care about is the student learning\n",
    "    - max of the summative vs standard grades\n",
    "        - can show the student a copy of an old exam as a sample of where we are going\n",
    "        - doing well on the project will do well on the exam\n",
    "- RESPONSE: the interviews suffer as the grader isn't an expert, so what are your thoughts on the matter\n",
    "    - interviewers aren't meant to be \"experts\" but rather a bit more experienced person in the loop. Someone that likely knows more about handling abstractions and solving hard problems\n",
    "    - they have the responsibility to understand the material in a deeper way then the student does.\n",
    "    - they should leverage knowledge of solving problems in general rather than the technical exam this project\n",
    "    - having said that, maybe the questions can be modified to better drive the student learning given this constraint. Consider some different questions and different ways of grading.\n",
    "    - graders want solutions and grades, but that's not the goal.\n",
    "        - Evan is aware that the interviews aren't perfect\n",
    "        - how do we manage time and manage staff (in 40/40/20)\n",
    "            - 2 teaching obligations: 20/20 classroom vs Phd students\n",
    "            - so 8hr per week is the expectation of a TTT Prof, but no one ONLY works 8 per week on the course\n",
    "    - peer interviewing idea certainly has merit\n",
    "    - DISAGREEMENT: the goal of the course isn't to create new knowledge, its still repeatable tasking\n",
    "        - the problems are new but maybe just a change of numbers\n",
    "        - \"create\" is the work of researchers and beyond the scope of a course\n",
    "        - \"evaluate\" or \"analyze\" is maybe more realistic as Evans goal is maybe a change to the numbers in the problem\n",
    "        - e.g. AVL tree from lab 1 interviews. often a point of contention for Evan and myself. Evan calls this a change of numbers, and in some sense I am beginning to agree with him.\n",
    "            - we considered a rephrase: here is a new funky tree or something.... maybe the term \"AVL\" is scaring people\n",
    "            - Note that in the lab students coded an unbalanced binary tree so they have coded the order checking invariant of a tree\n",
    "            - now we ask students to check the balance invariant of a tree\n",
    "            - GIVEN THIS LEVEL OF STUDENT... this could be perceived as a change of numbers to the problem. While I haven't seen it this way in the past and I feel certain that the current question phrasing doesn't align to this intention, I do understand Evans point and I certainly agree that this \"should\" be considered a change the numbers of the same problem.\n",
    "- hardest part for Evan: How do we communicating this?!\n",
    "- ASIDE: for my research\n",
    "    - I'm actually curious to continue an IS with Evan in the Spring\n",
    "    - the goal of the term is a sense of what research is really about\n",
    "    - so next term could lead to that ROI in, now that I'm developed as a researcher, I can actually do the research work and produce some real knowledge that benefits at least our class, if not also the scientific community.\n",
    "- ASIDE: one challenge is in setting expectations for students time\n",
    "    - University policy is 3:1\n",
    "    - 4 credit class is 12 hours per week of work\n",
    "    - 8 per week out of class\n",

    "    - The LA program has an emphasis on helping with diversity and support for historically marginalized student groups\n",
    "- My question: can coaching be used and help people outside of the technical space? Noting that many of the course staff are not technical experts can we re-purpose their role to coaching the students?\n",
    "    - yes, it doesn't require tons of explicit training\n",
    "    - although the most value in coaching is in review of the student current semester vs some previous semester e.g. I took this class last year and this is where we put our effort this next semester when taking the next course in the sequence (or retaking this same course)\n",
    "    - e.g. LAs focus on higher level thinking and asking the students to engage and master it themselves. they ask students follow up questions. They don't really solve the problem for the student.\n",
    "    - while some content knowledge that is important, its not the end of the value add proposition from the course staff\n",
    "    - if we can't get more teachers in the room (funding), then change the teaching method to leverage that scalable resource of student collaboration and self reflection. Consider those small working groups.\n",
    "    - RECALL: at times, the goal is not the right answer, but thinking about the problem and building skills to be able to solve for a correct solution at a later date.\n",

    "    - do the students have that common misconception and how do we correct it?\n",
    "    - this is particularly important in multiple choice clicker questions so you can identify if students are struggling in a perfectly common way. Over time you will find those important examples which help to easily clarify this common confusion and improve the student experience.\n",

    "    - In the modern era can we have intrensic rewards for the students to do the work?\n",
    "    - In a larger classroom I'm unsure that we can have hyper flexible assignments where students engage witht he content in their personal domain of interest as the grading is not performed by the prof, so how then can we bring these funds of knowledge to play? As the interview is no longer graded for accuracy in answering the questions perfectly, but rather in the students ability to conduct the interview, growing soft skills and learnign to assess their own work, perhaps here is a good opening for these kinds of assignsments. the interview questions can focus on students own area of interest related to the current course topics....\n",

    "##### notes in meeting\n",
    "- education theory suggests that education is emotional and social\n",
    "- diologic\n",
    "- we want the students to \"conspire with you to make it work\"\n",
    "- We consider meta education theory in the classroom: explain to the students why it matters\n",
    "    - this helps you learn more\n",
    "    - and helps you know why we think this should work\n",
    "    - it also helps the students build that common vocabulary around the culture that you are trying to build\n",
    "- we balance cognition and motivation (therory)\n",
    "    - Motivation: always aiming to give more agency to the students\n",
    "    - Cognition: we get the students to build cognitive insights\n",
    "- It is then important to know the education theory to be successful in the long term and help hold your boundaries. We seek to understand the theory of why this should work\n",
    "    - interviews are referred to as \"formative assessment\" in the literature\n",
    "    - We then focus on \"improvement based\" feedback over just a letter grade\n",
    "    - this serves to help \"scaffold\" later \"compulsitory??\" and \"evidence assessments\"\n",
    "    - The goals is a safe space and \"scaffolding\" to get them ready for the later tasks\n",
    "- the data shows clearly that grading distorts motivation\n",
    "    - so maybe we don't grade the interviews at all\n",
    "    - our time is completely on getting the students to do work\n",
    "    - how do we enforce it? We sell it. We keep selling it until it works. But do it in an informed way. \n",
    "        - e.g. show them the value. Have them take a quiz w/o an interview. then do the interview, then take a different quiz.\n",
    "- so how do we get students to do the work without extrinsic motivators? I talk about Evans \"warm but firm\" and the students are going to try to push against the boundaries that we set. We need to hold the boundaries. We can only do that if we the staff really believe in the system and want to do everything that we can to make it work.\n",
    "- It's acceptable to talk about efficiency constraints: \n",

    "    - the \"funds of knowledge\" idea is great there as well. \n",
    "    - talks about \"formative assessment\" as well.\n",
    "- there are easily 600 studies on how to give effective feedback.\n",
    "- Lorrie asks: \"is every student working on the same thing?\" I didn't explain that well...\n",
    "- Lectrures: you find the patterns and collect instances of the challenges. \n",
    "- it is sometimes troublesome for students to identify what they don't know.\n",
    "    - its more productive to identify and build on what they do know\n",
    "    - \"learning progressions\" are sometimes the opposite in the literature as they focus on teaching students what they don't know, but in the end it serves as the base to help us know the scaffolding and how to build students ability based on what they already know. \n",
    "    - conversations with staff, understand what they do get stuck on and what they do know.\n",
    "- We can learn the most from seeing the examples that students come up with\n",
    "    - I saw this in my Community Based Design course where the graduate students lead about 90% of the lectures and the instructor was there to guide the topics and highlight those key things if we miss them.\n",

    "    - where did they get stuck?\n",
    "    - Who said what that got us past being stuck?\n",

    "    - yourself and the staff...\n",
