    "# Monday 12/4\n",
    "Having completed the midterm review, I have a new emphasis to locate members of the education faculty to engage with my work and learn from an expert in this field if I am on the correct track. I had great discussions with <a href=\"https://www.colorado.edu/cadre/jessica-alzen\">Jessica Alzen</a> and <a href=\"https://www.colorado.edu/education/lorrie-shepard\">Lorrie Shepard</a> about my work and its merits. Based on these discussions it appears that I am on the correct track, but there is plenty of room to refine the concepts. One point that I ran with is changing the goal of feedback collection from the students. Like in HCI, we don't really want to ask the participants in our studies about what can be improved in the tool, but instead we observe them and ask follow up questions as they go to understand their mental model of the tool. We then used the data to infer what is and is not working. Finally, we can leverage what the participants know well to change how we present those tasks that people are doing poorly on. Accordingly I've changed the focus of the interview process to having students celebrate what they are succeeding on and changing the staff time to a review of the data to identify where students are succeeding and use that as scaffolding in future course work to help students (re)learn the things that they did not master sufficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "One point of interest that I'll highlight here is that they both mentioned the Universities <a href=\"https://www.colorado.edu/program/learningassistant/\">Learning Assistant (LA)</a> program. Writing this from the future, the LA program was actually developed at CU by our Physics department and has been employed at many other institutions. While this looks like a more complicated and better trained version of our departments internal Course Assistant (CA) program, I think it could be good to readdress the CA program with the department in the future. The CA program grew out of initiatives from myself and my peers to provide better peer to peer support for students in the program by effectively having the department hire tutors that did well in the course and support current students taking the course. The LA program takes this a step further and provides teacher training to its tutors."

    "Following the completion of my midterm presentation, Evan and I complete our midterm review lead by my self reflection of my complete work for the first half of the semester. In this discussion we agreed that I am Proficient ($\\checkmark$) and that achieving Advanced Understanding ($\\checkmark$+) is possible within the term. From there I had two key focuses for this sprint: a better lab notebook and connecting with faculty in the college of education. \n",
    "\n",
    "I finally moved my lab notebook away from markdown files without spell check up here to Jupyter Notebooks and I find the experience for more enjoyable to have rich text, easier editing abilities and spell check integrated to the tool. Following Evans advice, I keep my lab notebook as an edited summary of the day of research so that people can more easily understand the purpose of research that day and my findings, while my minutes document(s) separately hold my notes as I am doing the work and serve as a full log of tasking. In this sprint I changed my visualization to a heat matrix which is in the <a href=\"https://github.com/SpenceIsCool/PLEdu_IS_Fa23/blob/main/labNotebook.ipynb\">lab notebook for November 16</a> if you're interested to review.\n",
    "\n",
    "As for connecting with faculty in the college of education, this was a very intimidating prospect at first. However, as I scoured their web-page for faculty to read up on, I found my way into many inspiring writings and wells of references that I can dig further into to improve my breadth of knowledge on the education side of this research. Reaching out to three different professors I actually very quickly was able to set meetings with two of them for immediately after the Fall break. "
